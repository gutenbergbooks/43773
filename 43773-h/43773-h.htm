<p class="intro"><span class="smcap">After</span> days of fog Stanley Heath, a stranger whose power-boat
runs aground on the treacherous Cape Cod shoals, stumbles into the
Homestead and into the life of Marcia Howe, a young widow with whom
half the men in the village are already in love. Out of his clothing
falls a leather case crammed with gems and the enigma of this puzzling
possession provides the pivot around which the story revolves. Marcia's
blind, intuitive belief in the man's innocence brings its own reward.
The hamlets of Wilton and Belleport, already so well known to Miss
Bassett's readers, are again the setting of this new novel. A sparkling
love story of Cape Cod.</p>

<cite>Our lives are like the ever shifting sands<br />

Of their unresisting tides</cite></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I">Chapter I</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap"><cite>The Widder</cite></span> lived on the spit of sand jutting
out into Crocker's Cove.</p>

<p>Just why she should have been singled out by this
significant sobriquet was a subtle psychological
problem. There were other women in Belleport and
in Wilton, too, who had lost husbands. Maria Eldridge
was a widow and so was Susan Ann Beals. Indeed
death had claimed the head of many a household
in the community, for to follow the sea was a
treacherous business.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, despite the various homes in which
solitary women reigned, none of their owners was
designated by the appellation allotted to Marcia
Howe.</p>

<p>Moreover, there seemed in the name the hamlet
had elected to bestow upon her a ring of satisfaction,
even of rejoicing, rather than the note of condolence
commonly echoing in the term. Persons rolled it on
their tongues as if flaunting it triumphantly on the
breeze.</p>

<p>"Marcia ought never to have married Jason Howe,
anyway," asserted Abbie Brewster when one day she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
reminiscently gossiped with her friend, Rebecca Gill.
"She was head an' shoulders above him. Whatever
coaxed her into it I never could understand. She
could have had her pick of half a dozen husbands.
Why take up with a rollin' stone like him?"</p>

<p>"She was nothin' but a slip of a thing when she
married. Mebbe she had the notion she could reform
him," Rebecca suggested.</p>

<p>"Mebbe," agreed Abbie. "Still, young as she was,
she might 'a' known she couldn't. Ten years ago
he was the same, unsteady, drinkin' idler he proved
himself to be up to the last minute of his life. He
hadn't changed a hair. Such men seldom do, unless
they set out to; an' Jason Howe never set out to do,
or be, anything. He was too selfish an' too lazy.
Grit an' determination was qualities left out of him.
Well, he's gone, an' Marcia's well rid of him. For
'most three years now, she's been her own mistress an'
the feelin' that she is must be highly enjoyable."</p>

<p>"Poor Marcia," sighed Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Poor Marcia?" Abbie repeated. "Lucky Marcia,
I say. 'Most likely she'd say so herself was she
to speak the truth. She never would, though. Since
the day she married, she's been close-mouthed as an
oyster. What she thought of Jason, or didn't think
of him, she's certainly kept to herself. Nobody in
this village has ever heard her bewail her lot. She
made her bargain an' poor as 'twas she stuck to it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"S'pose she'll always go on livin' there on that deserted
strip of sand?" speculated Rebecca. "Why,
it's 'most an island. In fact, it is an island at high
tide."</p>

<p>"So 'tis. An' Zenas Henry says it's gettin' to be
more an' more so every minute," Abbie replied.
"The tide runs through that channel swift as a race
horse an' each day it cuts a wider path 'twixt Marcia
an' the shore. Before long, she's goin' to be as completely
cut off from the mainland at low water as at
high."</p>

<p>"It must be a terrible lonely place."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want to live there," shrugged the
sociable Abbie. "But there's folks that don't seem
to mind solitude, an' Marcia Howe's one of 'em.
Mebbe, after the life she led with Jason, she kinder
relishes bein' alone. 'Twould be no marvel if she did.
Furthermore, dynamite couldn't blast her out of that
old Daniels Homestead. Her father an' her grandfather
were born there, an' the house is the apple of
her eye. It is a fine old place if only it stood somewheres
else. Of course, when it was built the ocean
hadn't et away the beach, an' instead of bein' narrow,
the Point was a wide, sightly piece of land. Who'd
'a' foreseen the tides would wash 'round it 'til they'd
whittled it down to little more'n a sand bar, an' as
good as detached it from the coast altogether?"</p>

<p>"Who'd 'a' foreseen lots of pranks the sea's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
played? The Cape's a-swirl with shiftin' sands.
They drift out here, they pile up there. What's terra
firma today is swallered up tomorrow. Why, even
Wilton Harbor's fillin' in so fast that 'fore we know
it there won't be a channel deep enough to float a
dory left us. We'll be land-locked."</p>

<p>"Well, say what you will against the sea an' the
sand, they did a good turn for Marcia all them years
of her married life. At least they helped her keep
track of Jason. Once she got him on the Point with
the tide runnin' strong 'twixt him and the village,
she'd padlock the skiff an' there he'd be! She had
him safe an' sound," Abbie chuckled.</p>

<p>"Yes," acquiesced Rebecca. "But the scheme
worked both ways. Let Jason walk over to town
across the flats an' then let the tide rise an' there he
be, too! Without a boat there was no earthly way of
his gettin' home. Marcia might fidget 'til she was
black in the face. He had the best of excuses for
loiterin' an' carousin' ashore."</p>

<p>"Well, he don't loiter and carouse here no longer.
Marcia knows where he is now," declared Abbie with
spirit. "I reckon she's slept more durin' these last
three years than ever she slept in the ten that went
before 'em. She certainly looks it. All her worries
seem to have fallen away from her, leavin' her lookin'
like a girl of twenty. She's pretty as a picture."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"She must be thirty-five if she's a day," Rebecca
reflected.</p>

<p>"She ain't. She's scarce over thirty. I can tell
you 'xactly when she was born," disputed the other
woman. "But thirty or even more, she don't look
her age."</p>

<p>"S'pose she'll marry again?" ventured Rebecca,
leaning forward and dropping her voice.</p>

<p>"Marry? There you go, 'Becca, romancin' as
usual."</p>

<p>"I ain't romancin'. I was just wonderin'. An' I
ain't the only person in town askin' the question,
neither," retorted Mrs. Gill with a sniff. "There's
scores of others. In fact, I figger the thought is the
uppermost one in the minds of 'most everybody."</p>

<p>Abbie laughed.</p>

<p>"Mebbe. In fact, I reckon 'tis," conceded she.
"It's the thought that come to everyone quick as
Jason was buried. 'Course, 'twouldn't be decent to
own it&mdash;an' yet I don't know why. Folks 'round
about here are fond of Marcia an' feel she's been
cheated out of what was her rightful due. They want
her to begin anew an' have what she'd oughter have
had years ago&mdash;a good husband an' half a dozen children.
There's nothin' to be ashamed of in a wish like
that. I ain't denyin' there are certain persons who
are more self-seekin'. I ain't blind to the fact that
once Jason was under the sod, 'bout every widower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in town sorter spruced up an' began to take notice;
an' before a week was out every bachelor had bought
a new necktie. Eben Snow told me so an' he'd
oughter know bein' the one that sells 'em."</p>

<p>"Abbie!"</p>

<p>"It's true. An' why, pray, shouldn't the men cast
sheep's eyes at Marcia? Can you blame 'em? She'd
be one wife in a hundred could a body win her.
There ain't a thing she can't do from shinglin' a barn
down to trimmin' a hat. She's the match of any old
salt at sailin' a boat an' can pull an oar strong as the
best of 'em. Along with that she can sew, cook, an'
mend; plow an' plant; paper a room. An' all the
time, whatever she's doin', she'd bewitch you with her
smile an' her pretty ways. It's a marvel to me how
she's kept out of matrimony long's this with so many
men millerin' 'round her."</p>

<p>"She certainly's takin' her time. She don't 'pear
to be in no hurry to get a husband," smiled Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Why should she be? Her parents left her with
money in the bank an' the Homestead to boot, an'
Marcia was smart enough not to let Jason make
ducks and drakes of her property. She dealt out to
him what she thought he better have an' held fast to
the rest. As a result, she's uncommon well-off."</p>

<p>"All men mightn't fancy havin' a wife hold the
tiller, though."</p>

<p>Rebecca Gill pursed her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any man Marcia Howe married would have to
put up with it," Abbie asserted, biting off a needleful
of thread with a snap of her fine white teeth. "Marcia's
always been captain of the ship an' she always
will be."</p>

<p>Gathering up her mending, Rebecca rose.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't stay here settlin' Marcia's future,"
she laughed. "I've got to be goin' home. Lemmy'll
be wantin' his supper. He can't, though, accuse me
of fritterin' the afternoon away. I've darned every
pair of stockin's in this bag an' there was scores of
'em. You turn off such things quicker when you're
in good company."</p>

<p>A scuffling on the steps and the sound of men's
voices interrupted the words.</p>

<p>The kitchen door swung open and Zenas Henry's
lanky form appeared on the threshold. Behind him,
like a foreshortened shadow, tagged his crony,
Lemuel Gill.</p>

<p>"Well, well, 'Becca, if here ain't Lemmy come to
fetch you!" Abbie cried. "'Fraid your wife had deserted
you, Lemmy? She ain't. She was just this
minute settin' out for home."</p>

<p>"I warn't worryin' none," grinned Lemuel.</p>

<p>"What you two been doin'?" Abbie inquired of
her husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin' much," answered the big, loose-jointed
fellow, shuffling into the room. "We've been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
settin' out, drinkin' in the air."</p>

<p>The carelessness of the reply was a trifle overdone,
and instantly aroused the keen-eyed Abbie's suspicions.</p>

<p>She glanced into his face.</p>

<p>"Guess we're goin' to have rain," he ventured.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wonder," rejoined Lemuel Gill.</p>

<p>Humming to prove he was entirely at his ease,
Zenas Henry ambled to the window and looked out.</p>

<p>"Where you been settin'?" demanded Abbie.</p>

<p>"Settin'? Oh, Lemmy an' me took sort of a little
jaunt along the shore. Grand day to be abroad. I
never saw a finer. The sea's blue as a corn-flower,
an' the waves are rollin' in, an' rollin' in, an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They generally are," Abbie interrupted dryly.
"Just where'd you particularly notice 'em?"</p>

<p>Lemuel Gill stepped into the breach.</p>

<p>"'Twas this way," began he. "Zenas Henry an'
me thought we'd take a bit of a meander. We'd
been to the postoffice an' was standin' in the doorway
when we spied Charlie Eldridge goin' by with a
fish-pole&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Charlie Eldridge&mdash;the bank cashier?" Rebecca
echoed. "But he ain't no fisherman. What on earth
was he doin' with a fish-pole?"</p>

<p>"That's what we wondered," said Lemuel.</p>

<p>"Charlie Eldridge with a fish-pole," repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Abbie. "Mercy! Where do you s'pose he was
goin'?"</p>

<p>"I never in all my life knew of Charlie Eldridge
goin' a-fishin'," Rebecca rejoined. "Not that he
ain't got a perfect right to fish if he wants to outside
bankin' hours. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Charlie fishin'!" interrupted Abbie, cutting
her friend short. "Why, he'd no more dirty his lily-white
hands puttin' a squirmin' worm on a fish-hook
than he'd cut off his head. In fact, I don't believe
he'd know how. You didn't, likely, see where he
went."</p>

<p>"Wal&mdash;er&mdash;yes. We did."</p>

<p>Zenas Henry wheeled about.</p>

<p>Clearing his throat, he darted a glance at Lemuel.</p>

<p>"Havin' completed the business that took us to
the store&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Havin', in short, asked for the mail an' found
there warn't none," laughed Abbie, mischievously.</p>

<p>Zenas Henry ignored the comment.</p>

<p>"We walked along in Charlie's wake," he continued.</p>

<p>"Followed him?"</p>

<p>"Wal&mdash;somethin' of the sort. You might, I
s'pose, call it follerin'," Zenas Henry admitted shamefacedly.
"Anyhow, Lemmy an' me trudged along
behind him at what we considered a suitable distance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where'd he go?" Rebecca urged, her face alight
with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Wal, Charlie swung along, kinder whistlin' to
himself, an' ketchin' his pole in the trees and brushes
'til he come to the fork of the road. Then he made
for the shore."</p>

<p>"So he was really goin' fishin'," mused Abbie, a
suggestion of disappointment in her voice.</p>

<p>"He certainly was. Oh, Charlie was goin' fishin'
right 'nough. He was aimed for deep water," grinned
Zenas Henry.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't ketch no fish in Wilton Harbor,"
sniffed Rebecca contemptuously. "Wouldn't you
think he'd 'a' known that?"</p>

<p>"He warn't," observed Zenas Henry mildly, "figgerin'
to. In fact, 'twarn't to Wilton Harbor he was
goin'."</p>

<p>With a simultaneous start, both women looked up.</p>

<p>"No-siree. Bank cashier or not, Charlie warn't
that much of a numskull. He was primed to fish in
more propitious waters."</p>

<p>"Zenas Henry, do stop beatin' round the bush an'
say what you have to say. If you're goin' to tell us
where Charlie Eldridge went, out with it. If not,
stop talkin' about it," burst out his wife sharply.</p>

<p>"Ain't I tellin' you fast as I can? Why get so het
up? If you must know an' can't wait another minute,
Charlie went fishin' in Crocker's Cove."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Crocker's Cove!" cried two feminine voices.</p>

<p>Zenas Henry's only reply was a deliberate nod.</p>

<p>"Crocker's Cove?" gasped Abbie.</p>

<p>"Crocker's Cove?" echoed Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Crocker's Cove," nodded Zenas Henry.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us! Why&mdash;! Why, he&mdash;he must
'a' been goin'"&mdash;began Abbie.</p>

<p>"&mdash;to see <cite>The Widder</cite>," Rebecca interrupted,
completing the sentence.</p>

<p>"I'd no notion he was tendin' up to her," Abbie
said.</p>

<p>"Wal, he warn't 'xactly tendin' up to her&mdash;least-way,
not today. Not what you could really call
tendin' up," contradicted Zenas Henry, a twinkle in
his eye. "Rather, I'd say 'twas t'other way round.
Wouldn't you, Lemmy? Wouldn't you say that instead
'twas she who tended up to him?"</p>

<p>Sagaciously, Lemuel bowed.</p>

<p>The tapping of Abbie's foot precipitated the remainder
of the story.</p>

<p>"You see," drawled on Zenas Henry, "no sooner
had Charlie got into the boat an' pulled out into the
channel than he had the usual beginner's luck an'
hooked a stragglin' bluefish&mdash;one of the pert kind
that ain't fer bein' hauled in. Law! You'd oughter
seen that critter pull! He 'most had Charlie out of
the boat.</p>

<p>"I shouted to him to hang on an' so did Lemmy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
We couldn't help it. The idiot had no more notion
what to do than the man in the moon.</p>

<p>"In our excitement, we must 'a' bellered louder'n
we meant to, 'cause in no time <cite>The Widder</cite> popped
outer the house. She took one look at Charlie strugglin'
in the boat, raced down to the landin' an' put
out to him just about at the minute he was waverin'
as to whether he'd chuck pole, line, an' sinker overboard,
or go overboard himself.</p>

<p>"Quicker'n scat she had the fish-pole, an' while we
looked on, Charlie dropped down kinder limp on the
seat of the boat an' begun tyin' up his hand in a
spandy clean pocket handkerchief while <cite>The Widder</cite>
gaffed the fish an' hauled it in."</p>

<p>"My soul!" exploded Abbie Brewster. "My soul
an' body!"</p>

<p>"Later on," continued Zenas Henry, "Charlie
overtook us. He'd stowed away his fish-pole somewheres.
Leastway, he didn't have it with him.
When Lemmy an' me asked him where his fish was,
he looked blacker'n thunder an' snapped out: 'Hang
the fish!'</p>

<p>"Seein' he warn't in no mood for neighborly conversation,
we left him an' come along home."</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II">Chapter II</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In the</span> meantime, Marcia Howe, the heroine of this
escapade, comfortably ensconced in her island homestead,
paid scant heed to the fact that she and her
affairs were continually on the tongues of the outlying
community.</p>

<p>She was not ignorant of it for, although too modest
to think herself of any great concern to others, her
intuitive sixth sense made her well aware her goings
and comings were watched. This knowledge, however,
far from nettling her, as it might have done had
she been a woman blessed with less sense of humor,
afforded her infinite amusement. She liked people
and because of her habit of looking for the best in
them she usually found it. Their spying, she realized,
came from motives of interest. She had never known
it to be put to malicious use. Hence, she never let
it annoy her.</p>

<p>She loved her home; valued her kindly, if inquisitive,
neighbors at their true worth; and met the
world with a smile singularly free from hardness or
cynicism.</p>

<p>Bitter though her experience had been, it had
neither taken from, nor, miraculously, had it dimmed
her faith in her particular star. On the contrary
there still glowed in her grey eyes that sparkle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
anticipation one sees in the eyes of one who stands
a-tiptoe on the threshold of adventure. Apparently
she had in her nature an unquenchable spirit of hope
that nothing could destroy. No doubt youth had
aided her to retain this vision for she was still young
and the highway of life, alluring in rosy mists, beckoned
her along its mysterious path with persuasive
hand. Who could tell what its hidden vistas might
contain?</p>

<p>Her start, she confessed, had been an unpropitious
one. But starts sometimes were like that; and did
not the old adage affirm that a bad beginning made
for a fair ending?</p>

<p>Furthermore, the error had been her own. She had
been free to choose and she had chosen unwisely.
Why whine about it? One must be a sport and play
the game. She was older now and better fitted to
look after herself than she had been at seventeen.
Only a fool made the same blunder twice, and if experience
had been a pitiless teacher, it had also been
a helpful and convincing one.</p>

<p>Marcia did not begrudge her lesson. Unquestionably,
it had taken from her its toll; but on the other
hand it had left as compensation something she
would not have exchanged for gold.</p>

<p>The past with its griefs, its humiliations, its heartbreak,
its failure lay behind&mdash;the future all before
her. It was hers&mdash;hers! She would be wary what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
she did with it and never again would she squander
it for dross.</p>

<p>Precisely what she wished or intended to make of
that future she did not know. There were times
when a wave of longing for something she could not
put into words surged up within her with a force not
to be denied. Was it loneliness? She was not so
lonely that she did not find joy in her home and its
daily routine of domestic duties.</p>

<p>On the contrary, she attacked these pursuits with
tireless zeal. She liked sweeping, dusting, polishing
brasses, and making her house as fresh as the sea
breezes that blew through it. She liked to brew and
bake; to sniff browning pie crust and the warm spiciness
of ginger cookies. Keen pleasure came to her
when she surveyed spotless beds, square at the corners
and covered with immaculate counterpanes.
She found peace and refreshment in softened lights,
flowers, the glow of driftwood fires.</p>

<p>As for the more strenuous tasks connected with
homemaking, they served as natural and pleasurable
vents for her surplus energy. She revelled in painting,
papering, shingling; and the solution of the
balking enigmas presented by plumbing, chimneys,
drains and furnaces.</p>

<p>If there lingered deep within her heart vague, unsatisfied
yearnings, Marcia resolutely held over these
filmy imaginings a tight rein. To be busy&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was her gospel. She never allowed herself to remain
idle for any great length of time. To prescribe the
remedy and faithfully apply it was no hardship to
one whose active physique and abounding vigor demanded
an abundance of exercise. Like an athlete
set to run a race, she gloried in her physical strength.</p>

<p>When she tramped the shore, the wind blowing her
hair and the rich blood pulsing in her cheeks; when
her muscles stretched taut beneath an oar or shot out
against the resistance of the tide, a feeling of unity
with a power greater than herself caught her up,
thrilling every fibre of her being. She was never unsatisfied
then. She felt herself to be part of a force
mighty and infinite&mdash;a happy, throbbing part.
Today, as she moved swiftly about the house and
her deft hands made tidy the rooms, she had that
sense of being in step with the world.</p>

<p>The morning, crisp with an easterly breeze, had
stirred the sea into a swell that rose rhythmically in
measureless, breathing immensity far away to its
clear-cut, sapphire horizon. The sands had never
glistened more white; the surf never curled at her
doorway in a prettier, more feathery line. On the
ocean side, where winter's lashing storms had thrown
up a protecting phalanx of dunes, the coarse grasses
she had sown to hold them tossed in the wind, while
from the Point, where her snowy domains dipped
into more turbulent waters, she could hear the grat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>ing roar of pebbles mingle with the crash of heavier
breakers.</p>

<p>It all spoke to her of home&mdash;home as she had
known it from childhood&mdash;as her father and her
father's father had known it. Boats, nets, the
screaming of gulls, piping winds, and the sting of
spray on her face were bone of her bone, flesh of her
flesh. The salt of deep buried caverns was in her
veins; the chant of the ocean echoed the beating of
her own heart.</p>

<p>Lonely?</p>

<p>If she needed anything it was a companion to
whom to cry: "Isn't it glorious to be alive?" and she
already had such a one.</p>

<p>Never was there such a comrade as Prince Hal!</p>

<p>Human beings often proved themselves incapable
of grasping one another's moods&mdash;but he? Never!</p>

<p>He knew when to speak and when to be silent;
when to be in evidence and when to absent himself.
His understanding was infinite; his fidelity as unchanging
as the stars. Moreover, he was an honorable
dog, a thoroughbred, a gentleman. That was
why she had bestowed upon him an aristocratic name.
He demanded it.</p>

<p>She would never want for a welcome while he had
strength to wag his white plume of tail; nor lack affection
so long as he was able to race up the beach
and race back again to hurl himself upon her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
his sharp, staccato yelp of joy.</p>

<p>When easterly gales rocked the rafters and the
wind howled with eerie moanings down the broad
chimney; when line after line of foaming breakers
steadily advanced, crashing up on the shore with a
fury that threatened to invade the house, then it was
comforting to have near-by a companion unashamed
to draw closer to her and confess himself humbled in
the presence of the sea's majesty.</p>

<p>Oh, she was worlds better off with Prince Hal than
if she were linked up with someone of her own genus
who could not understand.</p>

<p>Besides, she was not going to be alone. She had
decided to try an experiment.</p>

<p>Jason had had an orphaned niece out in the middle
west&mdash;his sister's child&mdash;a girl in her early twenties,
and Marcia had invited her to the island for a visit.</p>

<p>In fact, Sylvia was expected today.</p>

<p>That was why a bowl of pansies stood upon the
table in the big bedroom at the head of the stairs, and
why its fireplace was heaped with driftwood ready
for lighting. That was also the reason Marcia now
stood critically surveying her preparations.</p>

<p>The house did look welcoming. With justifiable
pride, she confessed to herself that Heaven had bestowed
upon her a gift for that sort of thing. She
knew where to place a chair, a table, a lamp, a book,
a flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>She was especially desirous the old home should
look its best today, for the outside world had contributed
a richness of setting that left her much to
live up to. Sylvia had never seen the ocean. She
must love it. But would she? That was to be
the test.</p>

<p>If the girl came hither with eyes that saw not; if
the splendor stretched out before her was wasted
then undeterred, she might go back to her wheat
fields, her flat inland air, her school teaching.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, Wilton's beauty opened to
her a new heaven and a new earth, if she proved herself
a good comrade&mdash;well, who could say what
might come of it?</p>

<p>There was room, money, affection enough for two
beneath the Homestead roof and Sylvia was alone in
the world. Moreover, Marcia felt an odd sense of
obligation toward Jason. At the price of his life he
had given her back her freedom. It was a royal gift
and she owed him something in return.</p>

<p>She was too honest to pretend she had loved him
or mourned his loss. Soon after the beginning of
their life together, she had discovered he was not at
all the person she had supposed him. The gay recklessness
which had so completely bewitched her and
which she had thought to be manliness had been mere
bombast and bravado. At bottom he was a braggart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>&mdash;small, cowardly, purposeless&mdash;a ship without a
rudder.</p>

<p>Endowed with good looks and a devil-may-care
charm, he had called her his star and pleaded his need
of her, and she had mistaken pity for love and believed
that to help guide his foundering craft into
port was a heaven-sent mission.</p>

<p>Alas, she had over-estimated both her own power
and his sincerity. Jason had no real desire to alter his
conduct. He lacked not only the inclination but the
moral stamina to do so. Instead, day by day he
slipped lower and lower and, unable to aid him or
prevent disaster, she had been forced to look on.</p>

<p>Her love for him was dead, and her self-conceit
was dealt a humiliating blow.</p>

<p>She was to have been his anchor in time of stress,
the planet by which when he married her he boasted
that he intended to steer his course. But she had
been forced to stand impotent at his side and see
self-respect, honor, and every essential of manhood
go down and he shrivel to a fawning, deceitful, ambitionless
wreck.</p>

<p>Sometimes she reproached herself for the tragedy
and, scrutinizing the past, wondered whether she
might not have prevented it. Had she done her full
part; been as patient, sympathetic, understanding as
she ought to have been? Did his defeat lay at her
door?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>With the honesty characteristic of her, she could
not see that it did. She might, no doubt, have played
her role better. One always could if given a second
chance. Nevertheless she had tried, tried with every
ounce of strength in her&mdash;tried and failed!</p>

<p>Well, it was too late for regrets now. Such reflections
belonged to the past and she must put them
behind her as useless, morbid abstractions. Her back
was set against the twilight; she was facing the dawn&mdash;the
dawn with its promise of happier things.</p>

<p>Surely that magic, unlived future touched with
hope and dim with the prophecy of the unknown
could not be so unfriendly as the past had been.
It might bring pain; but she had suffered pain and
no longer feared it. Moreover, no pain could ever be
as poignant as that which she had already endured.</p>

<p>And why anticipate pain? Life held joy as well&mdash;countless
untried experiences that radiated happiness.
Were there not a balance between sunshine
and shadow this world would be a wretched place in
which to live, and its Maker an unjust dealer.</p>

<p>No, she believed not only in a fair-minded but in
a generous God and she had faith that he was in his
Heaven.</p>

<p>She had paid for her folly&mdash;if indeed folly it had
been. Now with optimism and courage she looked
fearlessly forward. That was why, as she caught up
her hat, a smile curled her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The house did look pretty, the day was glorious.
She was a-tingle with eagerness to see what it might
bring.</p>

<p>Calling Prince Hal, she stood before him.</p>

<p>"Take good care of the house, old man," she admonished,
as she patted his silky head. "I'll be home
soon."</p>

<p>He followed her to the piazza and stopped. His
eyes pleaded to go, but he understood his orders and
obeying them lay down with paws extended, the
keeper of the Homestead.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III">Chapter III</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> train was ten minutes late, and while she paced
the platform at Sawyer Falls, the nearest station,
Marcia fidgeted.</p>

<p>She had never seen any of Jason's family. At first
a desultory correspondence had taken place between
him and his sister, Margaret; then gradually it had
died a natural death&mdash;the result, no doubt, of his
indolence and neglect. When the letters ceased coming,
Marcia had let matters take their course.</p>

<p>Was it not kinder to allow the few who still loved
him to remain ignorant of what he had become and
to remember instead only as the dashing lad who in
his teens had left the farm and gone to seek his fortune
in the great world?</p>

<p>She had written Margaret a short note after his
death and had received a reply expressing such genuine
grief it had more than ever convinced her that
her course had been the wise and generous one.
What troubled her most in the letter had been its
outpouring of sympathy for herself. She detested
subterfuge and as she read sentence after sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
which should have meant so much and in reality
meant so little, the knowledge that she had not been
entirely frank had brought with it an uncomfortable
sense of guilt. It was not what she had said but
what she had withheld that accused her.</p>

<p>Marcia Howe was no masquerader, and until this
moment the hypocrisy she had practiced had demanded
no sustained acting. Little by little, moreover,
the pricking of her conscience had ceased and,
fading into the past, the incident had been forgotten.
Miles of distance, years of silence separated her
from Jason's relatives and it had been easy to allow
the deceit, if deceit it had been, to stand.</p>

<p>But now those barriers were to be broken down
and she suddenly realized that to keep up the fraud
so artlessly begun was going to be exceedingly difficult.
She was not a clever dissembler.</p>

<p>Moreover, any insincerity between herself and
Sylvia would strike at the very core of the sincere,
earnest companionship she hoped would spring up
between them. Even should she be a more skillful
fraud than she dared anticipate and succeed in playing
her role convincingly, would there not loom ever
before her the danger of betrayal from outside
sources?</p>

<p>Everyone in the outlying district had known
Jason for what he was. There had been no possibil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>ity of screening the sordid melodrama from the
public. Times without number one fisherman and
then another had come bringing the recreant back
home across the channel, and had aided in getting
him into the house and to bed. His shame had been
one of the blots on the upright, self-respecting
community.</p>

<p>As a result, her private life had perforce become
common property and all its wretchedness and degradation,
stripped of concealment, had been spread
stark beneath the glare of the sunlight.</p>

<p>It was because the villagers had helped her so
loyally to shoulder a burden she never could have
borne alone that Marcia felt toward them this abiding
affection and gratitude. They might discuss her
affairs if they chose; ingenuously build up romances
where none existed; they might even gossip about
her clothes, her friends, her expenditures. Their
chatter did not trouble her. She had tried them out,
and in the face of larger issues had found their virtues
so admirable that their vices became, by contrast,
mere trivialities.</p>

<p>Moreover, having watched her romance begin,
flourish, and crumble; and having shared in the joy
and sorrow of it, it was not only natural, but to some
degree legitimate they should feel they had the right
to interest themselves in her future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Not all their watchfulness was prompted by curiosity.
Some of it emanated from an impulse of
guardianship&mdash;a desire to shield her from further
misery and mishap. She was alone in the world, and
in the eyes of the older inhabitants who had known
her parents, she was still a girl&mdash;one of the daughters
of the town. They did not mean to stand idly
by and see her duped a second time.</p>

<p>The assurance that she had behind her this support;
that she was respected, beloved, held blameless
of the past, not only comforted but lent to her
solitary existence a sense of background which acted
as a sort of anchor.</p>

<p>Not that she was without standards or ideals.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, human nature is human nature and
it did her no harm to realize she was not an isolated
being whose actions were of no concern to anyone in
the wide world.</p>

<p>Separated though she was by the confines of her
island home, she was not allowed to let her remoteness
from Wilton detach her from it, nor absolve her
from her share in its obligations. She had her place
and every day of the year a score of lookers-on, familiar
with her general schedule, checked up on her
fulfillment of it.</p>

<p>If, given limited leeway, she did not appear for her
mail or for provisions; if she was not at church; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the lights that should have twinkled from her windows
were darkened, someone unfailingly put out
across the channel to make sure all was well with
her. Nay, more, if any emergency befell her, she
had only to run up a red lantern on the pole beside
her door and aid would come. What wonder then
that, in face of such friendliness, Marcia Howe failed
to resent the community's grandmotherly solicitude?</p>

<p>She had never kept secrets from her neighbors&mdash;indeed
she never had had secrets to keep. Her nature
was too crystalline, her love of truth too intense.</p>

<p>If she had followed her usual custom and been
open with Jason's sister, the dilemma in which she
now found herself would never have arisen. Granted
that her motive had been a worthy one had it not
been audacious to make of herself a god and withhold
from Margaret Hayden facts she had had every
right to know, facts that belonged to her? Such burdens
were given human beings to bear, not to escape
from.</p>

<p>Why should she have taken it upon herself to
shield, nay prevent Jason's flesh and blood from participating
in the sorrow, shame, disappointment she
herself had borne? The experience had had immeasurable
influence in her own life. Why should
it not have had as much in Margaret's?</p>

<p>Alas, matters of right and wrong, questions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
one's responsibility toward others were gigantic,
deeply involved problems. What her duty in this
particular case had been she did not and would now
never know, nor was it of any great moment that she
should. Margaret was beyond the reach of this
world's harassing enigmas. If with mistaken kindness
she had been guided by a pygmy, short-sighted
philosophy, it was too late, reflected Marcia, for her
to remedy her error in judgment.</p>

<p>But Sylvia&mdash;Jason's niece?</p>

<p>With her coming, all the arguments Marcia had
worn threadbare for and against the exposure of
Jason's true character presented themselves afresh.
Should she deceive the girl as she had her mother?
Or should she tell her the truth?</p>

<p>She was still pondering the question when a shrill
whistle cut short her reverie.</p>

<p>There was a puffing of steam; a grinding of brakes,
the spasmodic panting of a weary engine and the
train, with its single car, came to a stop beside the
platform.</p>

<p>Three passengers descended.</p>

<p>The first was a young Portuguese woman, dark of
face, and carrying a bulging bag from which protruded
gay bits of embroidery.</p>

<p>Behind her came a slender, blue-eyed girl, burdened
not only with her own suit-case but with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
basket apparently belonging to a wee, wizened old
lady who followed her.</p>

<p>"Now we must find Henry," the girl was saying in
a clear but gentle voice. "Of course he'll be here.
Look! Isn't that he&mdash;the man just driving up in a
car? I guessed as much from your description. You
need not have worried, you see. Yes, the brakeman
has your bag and umbrella; and here is the kitten
safe and sound, despite her crying. Goodbye, Mrs.
Doane. I hope you'll have a lovely visit with your
son."</p>

<p>The little old lady smiled up at her.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, my dear. You've taken care of me
like as if you'd been my own daughter. I ain't much
used to jauntin' about, an' it frets me. Are your
folks here? If not, I'm sure Henry wouldn't
mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, somebody'll turn up to meet me, Mrs.
Doane. I'll be all right. Goodbye. We did have a
pleasant trip down, didn't we? Traveling isn't
really so bad after all."</p>

<p>Then as Marcia watched, she saw the lithe young
creature stoop suddenly and kiss the withered cheek.</p>

<p>The next instant she was swinging up the platform.</p>

<p>The slim figure in its well-tailored blue suit; the
trimly shod feet; the small hat so provokingly tilted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
over the bright eyes, the wealth of golden curls that
escaped from beneath it all shattered Marcia's calculations.
She had thought of Sylvia Hayden as
farm-bred&mdash;the product of an inland, country town&mdash;a
creature starved for breadth of outlook and social
opportunity. It was disconcerting to discover
that she was none of these things.</p>

<p>In view of her sophistication, Marcia's proposed
philanthropy took on an aspect of impertinence.</p>

<p>Well, if she herself was chagrined, there was consolation
in seeing that the girl was equally discomfited.</p>

<p>As she approached Marcia, she accosted her uncertainly
with the words:</p>

<p>"Pardon me. I am looking for a relative&mdash;a
Mrs. Howe. You don't happen to know, do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm Marcia."</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;I expected&mdash;" gasped the girl.</p>

<p>"And I thought&mdash;I expected&mdash;" Marcia mimicked
gaily.</p>

<p>For a moment they looked searchingly into one
another's faces, then laughed.</p>

<p>"Fancy having an aunt like you!" exclaimed the
incredulous Sylvia, still staring with unconcealed
amazement.</p>

<p>"And fancy having a niece like you!"</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is I'm glad I came," was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
girl's retort. "I wasn't altogether sure I should be
when I started East. I said to myself: 'Sylvia you
are taking a big chance. You may just be wasting
your money.'"</p>

<p>"You may still find it's been wasted."</p>

<p>"No, I shan't. I know already it has been well
spent," announced the girl, a whimsical smile curving
her lips.</p>

<p>"Wait until you see where you're going."</p>

<p>"I am going to Paradise&mdash;I'm certain of it. The
glimpses I've had of the ocean from the train have
convinced me of that. Do you live where you can
see it, Aunt Marcia? Will it be nearby?"</p>

<p>"I shall not tell you one thing," Marcia replied.
"At least only one, and that is that I flatly refuse
to be Aunt Marcia to you!"</p>

<p>"Don't you like me?" pouted Sylvia, arching her
brows.</p>

<p>"So much that your aunt-ing me is absurd. It
would make me feel like Methuselah. I really
haven't that amount of dignity."</p>

<p>"Ah, now my last weak, wavering doubt is vanquished.
Not only am I glad I came but I wish I'd
come before."</p>

<p>She saw a shadow flit across her aunt's face.</p>

<p>"You weren't asked until now," observed Marcia
with cryptic brevity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"That wouldn't have mattered. Had I known
what you were like, I should have come without an
invitation."</p>

<p>In spite of herself, Marcia smiled.</p>

<p>"Here's the car," she answered. "What about
your trunk?"</p>

<p>"I didn't bring one."</p>

<p>"You didn't bring a trunk! But you are to make
a long visit, child."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wasn't sure that I'd want to," Sylvia
replied. "You see, I was a wee bit afraid of you.
I thought you'd be a New England prune. I had no
idea what you were like. If I'd brought my things,
I'd have been obliged to stay."</p>

<p>"You're a cautious young person," was Marcia's
dry observation. "'Twould serve you right if I sent
you home at the end of a fortnight."</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't do that," begged Sylvia. "It's
in <cite>The Alton City Courier</cite> that I have gone East to
visit relatives for a few weeks. If I should come right
back, everybody would decide I'd stolen the family
silver or done something disgraceful. Besides&mdash;my
trunk is all packed, locked, strapped and I've
brought the key," added she with disarming frankness.
"It can be sent for in case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see!" nodded Marcia, her lips curving into a
smile in spite of herself, "I said you were cautious."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you ever watch your own step?"</p>

<p>As the myriad pros and cons she had weighed and
eliminated before inviting her guest passed in quick
review before Marcia's mind, she chuckled:</p>

<p>"Sometimes I do," she conceded grimly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_IV" id="Chapter_IV">Chapter IV</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village store, grandiloquently styled by a red
sign the Wilton Emporium, was thronged with the
usual noontime crowd.</p>

<p>It was a still, grey day, murky with fog and the
odors of wet oilskins, steaming rubber coats, damp
woolens blended with a mixture of tar, coffee and
tobacco smoke, made its interior thick and stuffy.
Long ago the air-tight stove had consumed such remnants
of oxygen as the room contained. The windows
reeked with moisture; the floor was gritty with sand.</p>

<p>These discomforts, however, failed to be of consequence
to the knot of men who, rain or shine, congregated
there at mail time. They were accustomed
to them. Indeed, a drizzle, far from keeping the
habitués away, rendered the meeting place unusually
popular. Not but that plenty of work, capable of being
performed as well in foul as in fair weather, could
not have been found at home.</p>

<p>Zenas Henry Brewster's back stairs were at the
very moment crying out for paint; the leg was off
his hair-cloth sofa; the pantry window stuck; the
bolt dangled from his side door and could have been
wrenched off with a single pull.</p>

<p>Here was an ideal opportunity to make such
repairs. Yet, why take today?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody really saw the stairs. If the sofa pitched
the brick tucked underneath, it at least prevented it
from lurching dangerously. The pantry window was
as well closed as open, anyway. And as for the side
door&mdash;if it was not bolted at all, no great harm
would result.</p>

<p>"Nobody's got in yet," Zenas Henry optimistically
philosophized as, despite his wife's protests, he
slipped into his sou'wester, "an' I see no cause to
think thieves will pitch on today to come. Fur's that
goes, Wilton ain't never had a burglary in all its history.
We could leave all the bolts off the doors."</p>

<p>To this cheery observation he added over his shoulder
a jaunty "Goodbye!" and, striding out through
the shed, was off to join his cronies.</p>

<p>The argument with Abbie had not only delayed
him, but had left him a bit irritated, and he was more
nettled still to find, when he crossed the threshold of
the post-office, that the daily conclave was in full
swing. Nevertheless, the session had not become as
interesting as it would after those who dropped in
simply to call for mail or make purchases had thinned
out. He had, to be sure, missed seeing the letters
distributed, but the best yet remained.</p>

<p>Shuffling over to the counter where his friends were
huddled, Zenas Henry unostentatiously joined them.</p>

<p>"Yes-siree, there'll be somethin' doin' in Wilton
now," Enoch Morton, the fish-man, was saying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
"That sand bar's goin' to be the centre of the town,
if I don't miss my guess. There'll be more'n Charlie
Eldridge fishin' in the channel."</p>

<p>A laugh greeted the prediction.</p>

<p>"Who's seen her?" Captain Benjamin Todd inquired.</p>

<p>"I have," came the piping voice of Lemuel Gill.
"Me and 'Becca rowed over from Belleport Saturday.
We went a-purpose, takin' some jelly to Marcia as an
excuse. The girl's Jason's niece all right, same's folks
say, though she looks no more like him than chalk
like cheese. A prettier little critter 'twould be hard
to find. It 'pears that at the outset Marcia invited
her for no more'n a short visit. Inside the week,
though, the two of 'em have got so friendly, Sylvia's
sent home for her trunk, an' is plannin' to stay all
summer. She's head over heels in love with the place.
I'm almighty glad she's come, too, for it's goin' to be
grand for Marcia, who must be lonely enough out
there with only the setter for company."</p>

<p>"It's her own fault. She could have other companions
was she so minded," declared Captain
Phineas Taylor, significantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, we all know that, Phineas," agreed the gentle
Lemuel Gill. "There's plenty of folks hankerin' to
be comrades to Marcia. The only trouble is she
doesn't want 'em."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"With this girl at her elbow, she'll want 'em even
less, I reckon," Asaph Holmes interposed.</p>

<p>"Mebbe. Still, I figger that ain't a-goin' to discourage
her admirers none. Why, within the week
Sylvia's been here, I happen to know Marcia's had
four buckets of clams, a catch of flounders, an' a
couple of cuts of sword-fish presented to her,"
Ephraim Wise, the mail carrier announced.</p>

<p>"That stray blue-fish of Charlie Eldridge's must
'a' swelled the collection some, too," put in Lemuel.
"When I asked Charlie what he done with it, he
owned he left it over at the Homestead. He said he
never wanted to see another fish long's he lived."</p>

<p>"That ain't all the gifts The Widder's had,
neither," volunteered Silas Nickerson, the postmaster,
who now joined the group. "Not by a long shot.
I can see the whole of that spit of sand from my back
porch, an' often after I've had my supper an' set out
there smokin' an' sorter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sorter keepin' a weather eye out," chuckled a
voice.</p>

<p>"Smokin' an' takin' the air," repeated Silas, firmly.
"I look in that direction, 'cause it's a pleasant direction
to look. That's how I come to know more'n one
lobster's been sneaked to Marcia after dusk."</p>

<p>"I don't so much mind folks makin' Marcia
friendly donations," Captain Jonas Baker declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
with guilty haste. "In my opinion, it's right an'
proper they should. But when it comes to Eleazer
Crocker, who's head of the fire department an' undertaker
as well, goin' over there for the entire evenin'
with the keys to the engine house in his pocket, I
think the town oughter take some action 'bout it.
S'pose there was to be a fire an' him hemmed in by
the tide t'other side the channel? The whole village
might burn to the ground 'fore ever he could be
fetched home."</p>

<p>"That certainly ain't right," Zenas Henry agreed.
"Eleazer'd either oughter hang the keys on a bush
near the shore or leave 'em with some responsible
person when he goes a-courtin'."</p>

<p>"When you went courtin', would you 'a' wanted
the whole town made aware of it?" queried Enoch
Morton.</p>

<p>Chagrined, Zenas Henry colored.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, he's got no business goin' off the
mainland. Even if there ain't a fire, somebody might
die. He's a mighty important citizen, an' his place
is at home."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't go that fur," soothed peace-loving
Lemuel Gill. "Fires an' dyin' don't happen every
day."</p>

<p>"No. But when they do come, they're liable to
come sudden," maintained Zenas Henry stoutly.</p>

<p>"Not always. Besides, we've got to go a bit easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with Eleazer. Remember from the first he warn't
anxious to be undertaker, anyway. He said so over
an' over again," put in the gruff voice of Benjamin
Todd. "He 'xplained he hadn't a mite of talent for
the job an' no leanin's toward it. It was foisted on
him 'gainst his will."</p>

<p>"Well, somebody had to be undertaker. I didn't
hanker to be town sheriff, but I got hauled into bein',"
rejoined Elisha Winslow. "In a place small as this
honors sometimes go a-beggin' unless folks muster
up their public spirit."</p>

<p>"I don't see, 'Lish, that the duties of sheriff have
been so heavy here in Wilton that they've undermined
your health," grinned Captain Phineas Taylor.
"You ain't been what one could call over-worked by
crime. Was you to need a pair of handcuffs in a hurry,
it's my belief you wouldn't be able to find 'em. As
for Eleazer&mdash;nobody's died for nigh onto a year; an'
the only fire that's took place was a brush one that
we put out 'most an hour 'fore the key to the engine-house
could be found, the door unlocked, an' the
chemical coaxed into workin'."</p>

<p>"That's true enough," conceded Captain Benjamin.
"Still, I'll bet you a nickel was you to come
down hard on Eleazer, an' tell him that in future he'd
have to choose 'twixt undertakin' an' courtin', he'd
pick the courtin'. He's human. You can't press a
man too hard. Besides, you've no right to blame that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
mix-up 'bout the engine-house key on him, Cap'n
Phineas. Give the devil his due. Eleazer warn't responsible
for that. His sister borrowed the brass
polish for her candle-sticks an' afterward slipped the
key into her pocket by mistake. Remember that?
At the minute the fire broke out she was leadin' a
women's missionary meetin' at the church an' was in
the act of prayin' for the heathens out in China. It
didn't seem decent to interrupt either her or the Lord.
Unluckily the prayer turned out to be an uncommon
long one an' in consequence the chemical got delayed."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, I'm glad this niece of Marcia's
come," broke in Lemuel Gill, shifting the subject.
"She's a pleasant little critter an' will kinder stir
things up."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no danger but she'll do that all right,
Lemmy," Zenas Henry drawled. "You can generally
depend on a pretty girl to raise a rumpus. Give her
a month in town an' she'll most likely have all the
male population cuttin' one another's throats."</p>

<p>Fortunately both Marcia and Sylvia were at the
moment too far out of ear-shot for this menacing
prediction to reach them. Cut off by curtains of fog
and a tide that foamed through the channel, they
were standing in the homestead kitchen.</p>

<p>The builder of it would have laughed to scorn the
present day apology for an interior so delightful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was a room boasting space enough for an
old-fashioned brick oven; an oil stove; two sand-scrubbed
tables, snow white and smooth as satin; a
high-backed rocker cushioned in red calico; braided
rugs and shelves for plants. A regal kitchen truly&mdash;one
that bespoke both comfort and hospitality.</p>

<p>The copper tea kettle, singing softly and sending
up a genial spiral of steam, gleamed bright as sunshine;
and the two big pantries, through which one
glimpsed rows of shining tins and papered shelves
laden with china, contributed to the general atmosphere
of homeliness.</p>

<p>Fog might shroud the outer world in its blanket of
unreality, but it was powerless to banish from Marcia's
kitchen the cheer which perpetually reigned
there.</p>

<p>Before the fire, stretched upon his side, lay Prince
Hal, his body relaxed, his eyes drowsy with sleep;
while from her vantage-ground on the rocking-chair
above, the tiger kitten, Winkie-Wee, gazed watchfully
down upon his slumbers.</p>

<p>It was Sylvia, however, who, in a smock of flowered
chintz, lent the room its supreme touch of color. She
looked as if all the blossoms in all the world had suddenly
burst into bloom and twined themselves about
her slender body.</p>

<p>Out of their midst rose her head, golden with curls
and her blue eyes, large and child-like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>With her coming, a new world had opened to
Marcia.</p>

<p>The girl's lightness of touch on life; her irrepressible
gaiety; her sense of humor and unique point of
view all bespoke a newer generation and one far removed
from her aunt's environment. Not that she
was without moral standards. She had them, but
they were kept far in the background and were not
the strained and anxious creeds which the woman
of New England ancestry had inherited.</p>

<p>To see Sylvia jauntily sweep aside old conventions;
to behold the different emphasis she put upon
familiar problems; to witness her audacious belittling
of issues her elders had been wont to grapple with
was an experience that continually shocked, stimulated,
challenged and amused.</p>

<p>Yet, there was something big and wholesome in it
withal; something refreshingly sincere and free from
morbidity; a high courage that took things as they
came and never anticipated calamity.</p>

<p>Marcia found herself half reluctantly admiring
this splendidly normal outlook; this mixture of sophistication
and naïveté; her niece's novel and definitely
formed opinions.</p>

<p>For, youthful though Sylvia was, she had personality,
character, stratums of wisdom far in advance of
her years. A very intriguing companion, Marcia ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>mitted, one of whose many-sidedness she would not
soon tire.</p>

<p>"Now what shall our menu be, Marcia, dear?" she
was asking. "Remember, according to our compact,
it is my turn to get the dinner."</p>

<p>"Anything but fish!" Marcia answered with a
groan. "I'm so tired of salt-water products it seems
as if never again could I touch another."</p>

<p>"But my dear, if you will have a stag line of nautical
admirers, what can you expect? You must pay
the penalty. Besides, I think you're ungrateful,"
Sylvia pouted. "I love clams and other sea foods."</p>

<p>"You've not had so many of them in your lifetime
as I have. Besides, I suspect you are not telling the
truth. Come, confess. Aren't you a wee bit fed up
on clams? Clam chowder Monday night, steamed
clams Tuesday noon; clam fritters Tuesday night.
And then that blue-fish. Why, it was big as a shark!
I almost lost my courage when the sword-fish and
the flounders came, but fortunately with the aid of
Prince Hal and the kitten, we disposed of them fairly
well. The lobsters, alas, yet remain. I used to think
it would be romantic to be a Lorelei and live deep
down beneath the waves; but this avalanche of
fish&mdash;!" Despairingly she shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>Sylvia laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't feel at all like that. I've had a feast of
fish and enjoyed it. But if I were to express a prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>ence it would be for the hard-shelled suitors. Do
select one of those for a husband, Marcia," begged
she, whimsically. "The others are all very well.
Indeed, that blue-fish swain was magnificent in his
way, but me for the crustaceans."</p>

<p>"Sylvia! You absurd child!"</p>

<p>"Just consider the clam character for a moment&mdash;so
silent, so close-mouthed; never stirring up trouble
or wanting to be out nights. In my opinion, he would
be an ideal helpmate. Not sensitive, either; nor
jealous. Marcia, do marry one of the clams!</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," went on the girl reflectively,
"whether he would be affectionate. He seems somewhat
undemonstrative. Still, contrast him with the
lobster. Oh, I realize the lobster has more style,
originality, and is more pretentious in every way.
However, say what you will, he is grasping by nature
and has a much less gentle disposition. Besides, he is
restless and always eager to be on the move.</p>

<p>"Yes, all things taken together, I lean strongly
toward a nice, peaceable clam husband for you, Marcia.
He'd be twice as domestic in his tastes. I acknowledge
the blue-fish has more back-bone, but you
do not need that. You have plenty yourself. Most
women, I suppose, would be carried away by his
dash, his daring, his persistence. He has a certain
sporty quality that appeals; but he is so outrageously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
stubborn! He never gives in until he has to. He'd
be dreadful to live with."</p>

<p>"Sylvia, you are ridiculous!" Marcia protested.
"You forget I am your aunt."</p>

<p>"My mistake. I did forget it, I'll confess; and
what's more I probably always shall. To me you are
just a girl I'd be head-over-heels in love with if I were
a man. I don't blame all the clams, lobsters, and
flounders for flocking over here to make love to you."</p>

<p>"Stop talking nonsense."</p>

<p>"But it isn't nonsense. It's the truth. Isn't that
precisely what they're doing? You certainly are not
deluding yourself into thinking these men come gallivanting
out here over the flats with the mere philanthropic
purpose of seeing you don't starve to death,
do you?" Sylvia demanded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they come to see you," hedged Marcia
feebly.</p>

<p>"Me! Now Marcia, pray do not resort to deceit
and attempt to poke this legion of mermen off on me.
As a relative, I insist on having a truthful, respectable
aunt. Consider my youth. Isn't it your Christian
duty to set me a good example? Whether you
wed any of these nautical worshippers or not is your
own affair. But at least honesty compels you to acknowledge
they're your property."</p>

<p>A shadow, fleet as the rift in a summer cloud,
passed over Marcia's face, but transient as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Sylvia, sensitively attuned and alert to changes of
mood in others, noticed it.</p>

<p>"What a little beast I am, Marcia," she cried,
throwing her arm impulsively about the other
woman. "Forgive my thoughtlessness. I wouldn't
have hurt you for the world. You know I never saw
Uncle Jason. He left home when I was a child and
is no reality to me. Even mother remembered him
only as he was when a boy. She kept a little picture
of him on her bureau, and on his birthdays always
placed flowers beside it. She was fond of him, because
he was only six when Grandmother died.
After that, Mother took care of him and brought him
up. She worried a good deal about him, I'm afraid,
for it was a great responsibility and she herself was
nothing but a girl. However, she did the best she
could."</p>

<p>Sylvia stole a look at Marcia who had stiffened and
now stood with eyes fixed on the misty world outside.</p>

<p>"Mother felt sorry, hurt, that Uncle Jason should
have left home as he did, and never came back to see
her. He was an impulsive, hot-headed boy and she
said he resented her watchfulness and authority.
But even though he ran away in a moment of anger,
one would think years of absence would have
smoothed away his resentment.</p>

<p>"For a little while he wrote to her; then gradually
even his letters stopped. She never knew what sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of a man he became. Once she told me she supposed
there must be lots of mothers in the world who merely
sowed and never reaped&mdash;never saw the results of
their care and sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Jason&mdash;Jason loved your mother," Marcia murmured
in a voice scarcely audible. "I am sure of
that."</p>

<p>"But if he loved her, why didn't he come to see
her? I know it was a long journey, but if he could
only have come once&mdash;just once. It would have
meant so much!"</p>

<p>"Men are selfish&mdash;unfeeling. They forget," replied
Marcia, bitterly. "You give your life to them
and they toss aside your love and devotion as if it
were so much rubbish."</p>

<p>The outburst, sharp with pain, burst from her involuntarily,
awing Sylvia into silence.</p>

<p>What did she know of Jason, that dim heritage of
her childhood? Of Marcia? Of their life together,
she suddenly asked herself.</p>

<p>Dismayed, she stole a glance at her companion.</p>

<p>It was as if idly treading a flower-strewn path she
had without warning come upon the unplumbed
depths of a volcano's crater.</p>

<p>To cover the awkwardness of the moment, she bent
to caress Prince Hal who had risen and stood, alert
and listening beside her.</p>

<p>Only an instant passed before Marcia spoke again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>&mdash;this time with visible effort to recapture her customary
manner.</p>

<p>"Suppose we have lobster Newburg this noon,"
suggested she. "I'll get the chafing-dish. What's
the matter, Hal, old man? You look worried. Don't
tell me you hear more fish swimming our way?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_V" id="Chapter_V">Chapter V</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> nose of the setter quivered and, going to the
window, he growled.</p>

<p>"He does hear something," asserted Sylvia.
"What do you suppose it is?"</p>

<p>"Gulls, most likely. They circle above the house
in clouds," was Marcia's careless answer. "The
Prince regards them as his natural enemies. He delights
to chase them up the beach and send them
whirling into the air. Apparently he resents their
chatter. He seems to think they are talking about
him&mdash;and they may be for aught I know&mdash;talking
about all of us."</p>

<p>A faint echo of her recent irritation still lingered
in the tone and, conscious of it, she laughed to conceal
it.</p>

<p>Again the dog growled.</p>

<p>Almost immediately a hand fumbled with the
latch, and as the door swung open, a man staggered
blindly into the room.</p>

<p>He was hatless, wet to the skin, and shivering with
cold, and before Marcia could reach his side, he
lurched forward and fell at her feet.</p>

<p>"Quick, Sylvia, close the door and heat some broth.
The poor fellow is exhausted. He's chilled to the
bone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"No one I know&mdash;a stranger. Bring that pillow
and help me to slip it under his head. We'll let him
rest where he is a moment."</p>

<p>Her fingers moved to the bronzed wrist.</p>

<p>"He's all right," she whispered. "Just cold and
worn out. He'll be himself presently."</p>

<p>She swept the matted hair, lightly sprinkled with
grey, from the man's forehead and wiped his face.</p>

<p>An interesting face it was&mdash;intelligent and highbred,
with well-cut features and a firm, determined
chin.</p>

<p>A sweater of blue wool, a blue serge suit, socks of
tan and sport shoes to match them clung to the tall,
slender figure, and on the hand lying across it
sparkled a diamond sunk in a band of wrought gold.</p>

<p>It was not the hand of a fisherman, tanned though
it was; nor yet that of a sailor. There could be no
doubt about that. Rather, it belonged to a scholar,
a writer, a painter, or possibly to a physician, for it
was strong as well as beautifully formed.</p>

<p>Sylvia bent to adjust the pillow, and her eyes and
Marcia's met.</p>

<p>Who was this man?</p>

<p>Whence came he?</p>

<p>What disaster had laid him here helpless before
them?</p>

<p>As if their questions penetrated his consciousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the stranger slowly opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Sorry to come here like this," he murmured.
"The fog was so thick, I lost my bearings and my
power-boat ran aground. I've been trying hours to
get her off. She's hard and fast on your sand-bar."</p>

<p>"Not on the ocean side?" Marcia exclaimed.</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Luckily not. I rounded the point all right, but
missed the channel."</p>

<p>He struggled to rise and Marcia, kneeling beside
him, helped him into an upright position where he
sat, leaning against her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I seem to have brought in about half the sea with
me," he apologized, looking about in vague, half-dazed
fashion.</p>

<p>"No matter. We're used to salt water here," she
answered. "How do you feel? You're not hurt?"</p>

<p>"Only a little. Nothing much. I've done something
queer to my wrist."</p>

<p>Attempting to move it, he winced.</p>

<p>"It isn't broken?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I was trying to push the boat off,
and something suddenly gave way."</p>

<p>Turning his head aside, he bit his lip as if in pain.</p>

<p>"We'll telephone Doctor Stetson. The town is
fortunate in having a very good physician. Meantime,
you mustn't remain in these wet clothes. There
is no surer way of catching cold. Do you think you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
could get upstairs if Sylvia and I guided you?"</p>

<p>"I guess so&mdash;if it isn't far. I'm absurdly dizzy.
I don't know why. I suppose, though, I must shed
these wet togs."</p>

<p>"You certainly must. Come, Sylvia, lend a hand!
We'll help him up."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not in such a bad way as all that. I can
get up alone," he protested. "Only please wait just
another minute. The whole place has suddenly begun
to pitch again like a ship in midocean. Either
I've lost my sea-legs or I'm all sea-legs, and nothing
else. Perhaps I may be faint. I haven't eaten anything
for a day or two."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me? The soup, quick, Sylvia.
I only wish I had some brandy. Well, at least
this is hot, and will warm you up. I'll feed you."</p>

<p>"No, no. I needn't trouble you to do that. I'm
sure I can manage with my left hand."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. You'll spill it all over yourself.
Goodness knows, you're wet enough as it is. Hand
me the cup and spoon, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"But I feel like a baby," fretted the stranger.</p>

<p>"No matter. We must get something hot inside
you right away. Don't fuss about how it's done,"
said the practical-minded Marcia. "There! You
look better already! Later you shall have a real,
honest-to-goodness meal. Run and call Doctor Stetson,
Sylvia, and open the bed in the room opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mine. You might light the heater there, too."</p>

<p>As the girl sped away, Marcia turned toward her
visitor.</p>

<p>"Suppose we try to make the rocking-chair now.
Shall we? We won't aspire to going upstairs until
the doctor comes. You're not quite good for that
yet. But at least you needn't sit on the floor. What
worries me is your wet clothing. I'm afraid you'll
take your death of cold. Let me peel off your shoes
and socks. I can do that. And I believe I could get
you out of your water-soaked sweater if I were to cut
the sleeve. May I try? We needn't mind wrecking
it, for I have another I can give you."</p>

<p>The man did not answer.</p>

<p>Instead, he sat tense and unsmiling, his penetrating
brown eyes fixed on Marcia's face. Apparently
the scrutiny crystalized in him some swift resolution,
for after letting his glance travel about the room to
convince himself that no one was within hearing, he
leaned forward:</p>

<p>"There is something else I'd rather you did for me
first," he whispered, dropping his voice until it became
almost inaudible. "I've a package here I wish
you'd take charge of. It's inside my shirt. But for
this infernal wrist, I could reach it."</p>

<p>"I'll get it."</p>

<p>"I'd rather you didn't talk about it," continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
he, hurriedly. "Just put it in a safe place. Will you,
please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>Puzzled, but unquestioning, Marcia thrust her
hand beneath his sodden clothing and drew forth a
small, flat box, wrapped in a bedraggled handkerchief.</p>

<p>"If you'll look out for it, I'll be tremendously
obliged."</p>

<p>"Of course I will," smiled Marcia. "Is it valuable?"</p>

<p>The question, prompted by a desire to perform
faithfully the service entrusted to her, rather than
by curiosity, produced a disconcerting result.</p>

<p>The man's eyes fell.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to&mdash;to lose it," he stammered.</p>

<p>"I'll be careful. You yourself shall see where it
is put. Look! Here is my pet hiding-place. This
brick in the hearth is loose and under it is plenty of
space for this small box. I'll tuck it in there. Just
hold it a second until I pry the brick up. There we
are! Now give it to me."</p>

<p>She reached hurriedly for the package, but as their
hands met, the moist, clinging handkerchief became
entangled in their fingers and slipping from its coverings
a leather jewel-case dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>Out of it rolled a flashing necklace and a confusion
of smaller gems.</p>

<p>Marcia stifled an involuntary cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, she neither looked up nor delayed.</p>

<p>"Sorry to be so clumsy," she muttered, as she
swiftly scooped up the jewels.</p>

<p>It was well she had made haste, for no sooner was
the clasp on the box snapped and the treasure concealed
beneath the floor than Sylvia returned, and a
moment later came both Doctor Jared Stetson and
Elisha Winslow.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Marcia," nodded the doctor. "'Lish
happened to be in the office when your niece called
up, an' hearin' you had a man patient, he thought
mebbe he might be of use. What 'pears to be the
trouble, sir?"</p>

<p>"I've done something to my right wrist."</p>

<p>"H&mdash;m&mdash;m! Keepin' your diagnosis private,
I see. That's wise. A wrist can be broken, fractured,
dislocated, or just plain sprained an' still pain like
the deuce." With skilled hand, he pushed back the
dripping sleeve.</p>

<p>"You're a mite water-logged, I notice," observed
he. "Been overboard?"</p>

<p>"Something of the sort," returned the man with
the flicker of a smile.</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;" for the fraction of a second, Marcia
hesitated; then continued in an even tone, "&mdash;Mr.
Carlton grounded his boat and had to swim ashore."</p>

<p>"You don't say! Well, I ain't surprised. 'Tain't
no day to be afloat. You couldn't cut this fog with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
carvin'-knife. But for knowin' the channel well's I
do, I might 'a' been aground myself. How come you
to take your boat out in such weather?" the doctor
demanded.</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;was cruising."</p>

<p>"Oh, an' the fog shut down on you. I see. That's
different. Fog has a trick of doin' that, unless one
keeps an eye out for fog symptoms. Now, what I'd
recommend for you first of all, Mr. Carlton, is a warm
bed. You look clean beat out. Had an anxious,
tiresome trip, I'll wager."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I 'magined as much. Well, you can rest here.
There'll be nothin' to disturb your slumbers. We
sell quiet by the square yard in Wilton."</p>

<p>A kindly chuckle accompanied the words.</p>

<p>"Better let 'Lish an' me help you upstairs, an' out
of your wet things, 'cause with a wrist such as yours,
I figger you won't be very handy at buttons. Not
that 'Lish is a professional lady's maid. That ain't
exactly his callin'. Still, in spite of bein' town sheriff,
he can turn his hand to other things. It's lucky he
can, too, for he don't get much sheriffin' down this
way. Wilton doesn't go in for crime. In fact, we
was laughin' 'bout that very thing this noon at the
post-office. 'Pears there's been a robbery at one of
the Long Island estates. Quantities of jewelry taken,
an' no trace of the thief. The alarm was sent out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
over the radio early yesterday an' listenin' in 'Lish,
here, got quite het up an' not a little envious. He
said he 'most wished the burglary had took place in
our town, excitement bein' at a pretty low ebb now."</p>

<p>"Zenas Henry suggested mebbe we might hire an
up-to-date robber, was we to advertise," put in the
sheriff, "but on thinkin' it over, we decided the
scheme wouldn't work, 'cause of there bein' nothin'
in the village worth stealin'." He laughed.</p>

<p>Marcia, standing by the stove, spun about.</p>

<p>"Now, Elisha, don't you run down Wilton. Why,
I have twenty-five dollars in my purse this minute,"
she asserted, taking a worn pocket-book from her
dress and slapping it with challenging candor down
upon the table. "I keep it in that china box above
the stove."</p>

<p>"That might serve as a starter," remarked the
stranger, regarding her quizzically.</p>

<p>She faced him, chin drawn in, and head high and
defiant.</p>

<p>"Besides that, in my top bureau drawer is a string
of gold beads that belonged to my great-grandmother,"
she continued, daring laughter curling her
lips. "They are very old and are really quite
valuable."</p>

<p>"We'll make a note of those, too," nodded the man,
his eyes on hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's all I can offer in the way of
burglary inducements."</p>

<p>"That bein' the case, s'pose you an' me start gettin'
the patient upstairs, 'Lish," broke in Doctor Stetson.
"If we don't, next we know he'll be havin' pneumonia
as well as a bad wrist. Besides, I want to get a good
look at that wrist. Mebbe 'tain't goin' to be bad as
it 'pears."</p>

<p>The stranger's admiring glance fixed itself on
Marcia's.</p>

<p>"What is my next move?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I told you before&mdash;you must take off your wet
things and rest," she repeated.</p>

<p>"You still prescribe that treatment?"</p>

<p>"I still prescribe it."</p>

<p>"In spite of the&mdash;the symptoms?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" was her quick answer.</p>

<p>"Very well. I am ready, gentlemen." Erect, even
with a hint of defiance in his mocking smile, the man
rose to his full height. "Before we go, however, I
must correct a slight error. You misunderstood my
name. It is not Carlton. It is Heath&mdash;Stanley
Heath."</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VI" id="Chapter_VI">Chapter VI</a></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">And</span> yet you told me, Marcia, this was a quiet, adventureless
place!" burst out Sylvia, the instant the
door had closed.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem so to me. When shipwrecked
mariners fall into your arms entirely without warning,
I call it thrilling. Who do you suppose he is?"</p>

<p>"He told us his name."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;Heath. Stanley Heath. It's quite
a romantic name, too. But I didn't mean that. I
mean where did he come from and why? Didn't he
tell you?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>Obviously the girl was disappointed.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps he might have while I was
upstairs. I was gone long enough for him to pour
out to you his entire history. At least it seemed so
to me. I ransacked every closet and drawer in sight
trying to find something for him to put on. It
wasn't until I struck that old sea-chest in the hall
that I discovered pajamas and underwear. I hope
you don't mind my taking them."</p>

<p>A shiver passed over Marcia.</p>

<p>"No. They were Jason's. I ought to have told
you they were there. I kept them because I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
they might sometime be useful."</p>

<p>"Well, they certainly are," replied Sylvia. "They
will exactly fit Mr. Heath. He must be lots like
Uncle Jason."</p>

<p>"He isn't," contradicted Marcia sharply. "He
isn't at all like him."</p>

<p>"In size, I mean," amended Sylvia, timidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, in size. Possibly. I haven't thought about
it," came tersely from Marcia. "Let me see! We
planned to have lobster this noon, didn't we? But
that won't do for him. He will need something more
substantial."</p>

<p>"There are chops," suggested Sylvia, following to
the door.</p>

<p>"So there are!" Marcia brightened. "I'd forgotten
that. We have had such a confusing morning&mdash;"
absently she reached for the plates.</p>

<p>"Shall I put some potatoes in the oven?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Potatoes. Shall I put some in the oven? For
him, I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;yes. Of course. Chops and&mdash;" regarding
the girl vaguely, Marcia fingered the dishes
in her hand.</p>

<p>"And baked potatoes," Sylvia repeated, a trifle
sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes. Chops and baked potatoes," echoed Marcia,
dragging her mind with an effort from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
thoughts she was pursuing. "That will do nicely.
And hot tea."</p>

<p>"Won't tea keep him awake?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe anything could keep him awake."</p>

<p>Marcia was herself now and smiled.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose he came from? And how
long has he been knocking about in that boat, I wonder,"
ventured Sylvia, her curiosity once again
flaring up.</p>

<p>"How do I know, dear?" Marcia sighed, as if determined
to control her patience. "You know as
much about him as I do. I mean," she corrected,
honesty forcing her to amend the assertion, "almost
as much. I did, to be sure, talk with him a little
while waiting for the doctor, but he did not tell me
anything about himself."</p>

<p>"One would never suspect you were such a matter-of-fact,
unimaginative person, Marcia," laughed
Sylvia, "Now I am much more romantic. I am
curious&mdash;just plain, commonplace curious&mdash;and I
don't mind admitting it."</p>

<p>Again Marcia's conscience triumphed.</p>

<p>"I am curious, too," she confessed. "Only perhaps
in a different way."</p>

<p>The moving of chairs overhead and the sound of
feet creaking down the stairway heralded the return
of Jared Stetson and Elisha.</p>

<p>She went to meet them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tain't a broken wrist, Marcia," was the doctor's
greeting on entering the kitchen. "Leastways, I
don't think it is. I've bandaged it an' 'Lish an' me
have your friend snug an' warm in bed. Tomorrow
I'll look in again. Mebbe with daylight, I'll decide
to whisk him down to the Hyannis Hospital for an
X-ray just to make sure everything's O.K. There's
no use takin' chances with a thing so useful to a
feller as his wrist. But for tonight, the bandage will
do. A hot water-bottle mightn't be amiss. Nor a
square meal, neither. Beyond them two things,
there ain't much you can do at present, but let him
sleep."</p>

<p>"We were starting to broil some chops."</p>

<p>"Fine!" Doctor Stetson rubbed his hands.
"Nothin' better. He was a mite fretted 'bout the
boat; but I told him some of us men would ease her
up 'fore dark an' see she was anchored good an' firm.
There's a chance she'll float at high tide, I wouldn't
wonder&mdash;that is if she ain't stuck too firm. The
Life-Savin' crew will lend us a hand, I reckon.
Cap'n Austin an' the boys have been itchin' for a
job. Anyhow, I told Mr. Heath to quit troublin'
'bout his ship an' go to sleep, an' he promised he
would. Seems a nice sort of feller. Known him
long?"</p>

<p>"Not so very long."</p>

<p>"Why, Marcia&mdash;" broke in Sylvia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"One sometimes comes to know a person rather
well, though, even in a short time," went on the
older woman, ignoring the interruption.</p>

<p>"S'pose 'twas a-comin' to see you that brought
him down this way," Elisha volunteered. "Somehow
I don't recall meetin' him before."</p>

<p>"He hasn't been here before," was the measured
response.</p>

<p>"Oh, so he's new to Wilton waters, eh? That
prob'ly accounts for his runnin' aground. I was
certain I'd 'a' remembered his face had I seen it.
I'm kinder good at faces," declared the sheriff.
"Fine lookin' chap. Has quite an air to him.
Nothin' cheap 'bout his clothes, neither. They was
A1 quality clear through to his skin. Silk, with
monograms on 'em. Must be a man of means."</p>

<p>Silence greeted the observation.</p>

<p>"Likely he is&mdash;havin' a power-boat an' leisure to
cruise round in her," persisted the undaunted Elisha.</p>

<p>"I really couldn't say."</p>

<p>"Well, apparently he ain't one that boasts of his
possessions, an' that's to his credit," interposed Jared
Stetson good-humoredly.</p>

<p>Elisha's interest in the stranger was not, however,
to be so easily diverted.</p>

<p>"Seen the boat?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh, you ain't! I forgot to ask Heath the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of her. I'm sort of a crank on the names of boats.
It always riles me to have a foolish name given a
boat. No matter how small she is, her plankin' is
all that divides her owner from fathoms of water, an'
in view of the fact he'd oughter regard her soberly
an' give her a decent name."</p>

<p>Elisha stroked his chin, rough with the stubble of
a reddish beard.</p>

<p>"Years ago," he continued, "folks stood in awe of
ships an' understood better what they owed 'em. In
them days there warn't no wireless, nor no big ocean
liners an' a man that sailed the deep warn't so hail-feller-well-met
with the sea. It put the fear of God
into him. When he started out on a cruise across
the Atlantic or round the Horn, there warn't no
slappin' his ship on the back. He respected her an'
named her accordin'ly. <cite>The Flyin' Cloud!</cite> Can
you beat that? Or <cite>Sovereign of the Seas</cite>? Them
names meant somethin'. They made you want to
lift your hat to the lady. But now&mdash;! Why, last
season a feller come into the harbor with as pretty
a knockabout as you'd want to see. Small though
she was, every line of her was of the quality. A
reg'lar little queen she was. An' what do you s'pose
that smart aleck had christened her? The <cite>Ah-there</cite>!
Thought himself funny, no doubt. 'Twould
'a' served him right had she capsized under him some
day when he was well out of sight of land an' left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
him to swim ashore. Yes-siree, it would. If a man
has no more regard for the keel that's under him an'
the floorin' that's 'twixt him an' forty fathoms of
water than that he deserves to drown an' I wouldn't
care the flip of a cod's tail if he did," Elisha blustered.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, 'Lish&mdash;you know you wouldn't
stand by an' see no feller drown, no matter what
kind of a fool he was," laughed the doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would," Elisha insisted, tugging on his
coat.</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is I hope the name of Mr.
Heath's boat will meet with your approval," ventured
Sylvia archly.</p>

<p>"I hope 'twill," was the glum retort, as the sheriff
followed Doctor Stetson through the doorway.</p>

<p>The moment the door banged behind them, Sylvia
turned toward Marcia.</p>

<p>"Forgive my butting in, dear," apologized she.
"But I was so surprised. You did say you didn't
know Mr. Heath, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sometimes it's just as well not to tell all you
know&mdash;especially in a place like this," was the evasive
response.</p>

<p>Was the reply a rebuke or merely a caution?</p>

<p>Sylvia did not know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>And what was the meaning of the rose color that
flooded the elder woman's cheek?</p>

<p>Had Marcia really meant to give the impression
that she knew Stanley Heath? And if so, why?</p>

<p>Sylvia wracked her brain for answers to these
questions.</p>

<p>Why, only an hour before, she and Marcia had
been on the frankest footing imaginable. Now, like
a sea-turn, had come a swift, inexplicable change
whose cause she was at a loss to understand and
which had rendered her aunt as remote as the
farthest star.</p>

<p>Sylvia would have been interested indeed had she
known that while she wrestled with the enigma,
Marcia, to all appearances busy preparing the tray
for the invalid upstairs, was searching her heart for
answers to the same questions.</p>

<p>Why had she sought to shield this stranger?</p>

<p>Why had she evaded Doctor Stetson's inquiries
and deliberately tried to mislead him into thinking
she and Stanley Heath were friends?</p>

<p>What had prompted the deception?</p>

<p>The man was nothing to her. Of his past she had
not the slightest knowledge, indeed he might be the
greatest villain in the world. In fact, circumstances
proclaimed him a thief. Nevertheless, she did not,
could not, believe it. There was something too fine
in his face; his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>True, he had made no attempt either to defend
himself or to explain away the suspicions he must
have known would arise in her mind. On the contrary,
with a devil-may-care audacity that fascinated
her, he actually appeared to have tried to deepen in
her mind the impression of his guilt.</p>

<p>Still she refused to believe. Even in the face of
overwhelming evidence she clung to her unreasoning
faith in him.</p>

<p>Suppose he had stolen the gems and fled with
them from Long Island? Suppose he had lost his
bearings in the fog; tossed aimlessly on the sea for
a day and a night; and then run aground at her
doorstep? It was possible, quite possible, even
probable.</p>

<p>Yet was it?</p>

<p>Not for a man like Stanley Heath. Marcia stubbornly
insisted. So deep was the conviction, she
shrank lest he should feel called upon to justify or
defend himself.</p>

<p>Far from demanding explanations, she resolved
she would give him no chance to make them.</p>

<p>Therefore, when his meal was ready and every last
inviting touch had been given the tray, she said
casually to Sylvia:</p>

<p>"Suppose you take it up, dear?"</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. Why not? Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I just thought perhaps you'd
rather."</p>

<p>Marcia shook her head.</p>

<p>"I want to stir the Newburg and see it doesn't
catch," she explained, avoiding the girl's eyes. "We
are too hungry to risk having our dinner spoiled.
You might just wait and cut the chops for Mr.
Heath and fix his potato. Find out, too, if there is
anything more he wants. You needn't hurry back.
I'll keep things hot."</p>

<p>The task suggested did not, apparently, displease
Sylvia.</p>

<p>She dimpled and sauntering to the mirror, she
glanced in giving her mass of golden curls a feminine
poke. She even slipped a vanity-case from her
pocket and powdered her wee, up-tilted nose.</p>

<p>"We may as well look our best," laughed she over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might take off my smock and go up in
my dark dress."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't. The smock is gay and suits you.
Invalids need cheering up."</p>

<p>"So they do," agreed Sylvia demurely, now quite
self-possessed.</p>

<p>A flutter of anticipation had put a sparkle into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
eyes and faint color into her cheeks. She looked bewilderingly
pretty.</p>

<p>"Here goes Red-Ridinghood," she murmured,
taking up the tray. "All is, if I don't come back,
you'll know the wolf has eaten me."</p>

<p>In spite of herself, Marcia smiled.</p>

<p>She opened the door and stood watching while the
girl ascended the stairs, for the hall was unlighted
and the tray heavy.</p>

<p>"I'm safe," called a merry voice from the topmost
stair.</p>

<p>Marcia came back into the kitchen. She finished
preparing the lobster, straightened the silver on the
table, let in Prince Hal who came bounding to her
side, picked a few dead blossoms from the geraniums,
and sat down to wait.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed!</p>

<p>Fifteen!</p>

<p>Half an hour went by.</p>

<p>She fidgeted and stooped to pat the setter. Then
she went to the window. Slowly the fog was lifting.
It hung like a filmy curtain, its frayed edges receding
from a dull steel-blue sea and through it she
could discern the irregular sweep of the channel and
the shore opposite where dimly outlined stood the
spired church and the huddle of houses clustered like
wraiths about the curving margin of the bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, it was clearing.</p>

<p>The tide had turned and a breeze sprung up.</p>

<p>By afternoon the weather would be fine&mdash;just
the right sort to get the boat off. She would go up
the beach and watch the men while they worked.
The house was close. She longed for air and the big
reaches of the out-of-doors.</p>

<p>A jingle of glass and silver! It was Sylvia returning
with the tray. Her eyes were shining.</p>

<p>"He ate every bit!" she cried. "You should
have seen him, Marcia. It would have done your
heart good. The poor lamb was almost starved. He
asked for you the first thing. I don't think he altogether
liked your not carrying up the tray, although
of course, he was too polite to say so."</p>

<p>"You explained I was busy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But at first he didn't seem satisfied with
the excuse. However, he soon forgot about it and
became gay as a lark. Didn't you hear us laughing?
The potato would fall off the fork. I'm not as good
a nurse as you. My hands weren't so steady. I'm
going back again for his wet clothes. We can dry
them here by the fire, can't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"It's a pity there isn't a tailor at hand. His suit
ought to be pressed."</p>

<p>"I can do it," Marcia declared with eagerness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
"I'm quite used to pressing men's clothes. I always
pressed Jason's."</p>

<p>This time the name dropped unnoticed from her
lips. Indeed she was not conscious she had uttered
it. She was not thinking of Jason.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VII" id="Chapter_VII">Chapter VII</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late afternoon and, alone in the kitchen,
Sylvia yawned.</p>

<p>Since noontime she had sat reading and straining
her ears for a sound in the room overhead, but there
had been none. He was sleeping after his hearty
dinner and that was encouraging.</p>

<p>Doctor Stetson had hoped the wrist would not be
painful enough to interfere with the rest the patient
so obviously needed, and apparently this hope was
being realized.</p>

<p>Sylvia was glad he was asleep&mdash;very glad indeed.
She did not begrudge him a moment of his slumber.
But what a delightful person he was when awake!
His eyes were wonderful&mdash;so dark and penetrating.
They bored right through you. And then he
listened with such intentness, watching every curve
of your lips as if fearing to lose a word. Such attention
was distinctly flattering. Even though your
chatter was trivial, he dignified it and transformed
it into something of importance.</p>

<p>How interested, for example, he had been in Marcia;
in learning she had been married and now lived
a widow in the old Daniels Homestead! And what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a host of inquiries he had made about Jason&mdash;the
sort of man he was and how long ago he had died!</p>

<p>Sylvia had not been able to answer all his questions,
but of course she had asserted that Marcia had
adored her husband because&mdash;well, not so much because
she actually knew it, as because widows always
did. Certainly Marcia had declared she loved
the Homestead so deeply she never intended to
leave it, and was not that practically the same thing
as saying she loved Jason, too?</p>

<p>Anyway, how she had felt toward him was not
really a matter of any great importance now because
he was dead.</p>

<p>The thing that really mattered was Mr. Heath's
interest in her&mdash;Sylvia; in her trip East and her
description of Alton City, the little mid-western
town which was her home. How he had laughed at
her rebellion at being a school-teacher, and how insidiously
he had hinted she might not always
be one! And when she had tossed her curls at
him as she often tossed them at Billie Sparks,
the soda fountain clerk, how cleverly he had remarked
that sunlight was especially welcome on a
grey day.</p>

<p>Oh, he knew what to say&mdash;knew much better
than Billie Sparks or even Horatio Fuller, the acknowledged
beau of the town. In fact he made both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of them seem quite commonplace&mdash;even Hortie.
Fancy it!</p>

<p>Probably that was because he had traveled.</p>

<p>Apparently he had been almost everywhere&mdash;except
to Alton City. Odd he should never have been
there when he had visited just about every other
corner, both of America and of Europe. Not that he
had deliberately said so. He was far too modest for
that.</p>

<p>It was while trying to find out where his home was
that she had stumbled upon the information.</p>

<p>And come to think of it, she did not know now
where he lived, she suddenly remembered.</p>

<p>At the time she thought he had named the place;
but she realized on reviewing the conversation that
he had not. In fact, he had not told her much of
anything about himself. It had all been about surfboating
in the Pacific; skiing at Lake Placid and St.
Moritz; climbing the Alps; motoring in Brittany.</p>

<p>She actually did not know whether he had a
father or a mother; a brother or a sister.</p>

<p>At Alton City you would have found out all those
things within the first ten minutes.</p>

<p>Perhaps that was the reason he piqued her interest&mdash;because
he was not like Alton City&mdash;not like
it at all.</p>

<p>Why, were Stanley Heath to stroll up Maple Ave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>nue on a fine, sunny afternoon everybody&mdash;even
the boys that loafed in front of Bailey's cigar store
and the men who loitered on the post-office steps&mdash;would
turn to look at him.</p>

<p>He would be so different from everybody else he
would seem a being from another planet.</p>

<p>It would be fun, she mused, to walk with him
through this main street while those on both sides
of it craned their necks and asked one another who
he was. More fun yet to dash through its shaded
arch of trees in a smart little car, talking and laughing
with him all the way, and pretending to be unconscious
of the staring spectators, although of
course she would be seeing them all perfectly well
out of the corner of her eye.</p>

<p>She had done this sometimes with Hortie Fuller,
simply because she knew every girl in Alton City envied
her his devotion.</p>

<p>But what was Hortie compared with Mr. Stanley
Heath?</p>

<p>Sylvia tilted her small up-tilted nose even higher.</p>

<p>So occupied was she with these dramatic fancies
she had not thought once of Prince Hal. In fact
she had supposed that he had gone up the beach
with Marcia.</p>

<p>Now she suddenly became aware that he stood
sniffing about the hearth, scratching at its surface as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
if he scented something beneath.</p>

<p>He must not do that, and she told him so in no
uncertain terms.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of the rebuke, he continued
to poke away at the spot, whining faintly, until his
persistence aroused her curiosity and she went to
see what disturbed him.</p>

<p>One brick projected ever so slightly from the
others, and it was at this the setter was clawing.</p>

<p>"What is it, Prince? What's the matter?" whispered
she.</p>

<p>Delighted to have gained her attention, the dog
barked.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't bark, darling," she cautioned,
muzzling his nose with her hand. "You'll wake Mr.
Heath. Tell Missy what the trouble is. Do you
smell a mousie under there?"</p>

<p>For answer the dog wagged his tail.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," Sylvia demurred. "You're
only bluffing. Between you and Winkie-Wee there
isn't a mouse about the place. Still, you seem terribly
sure something is wrong. Well, to convince
you, I'll take up the brick."</p>

<p>Fetching from the pantry a steel fork, she inserted
the prongs in the crack and pried the offending brick
out of its hole.</p>

<p>Instantly the dog snatched from the space beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
a handkerchief containing a small, hard object.</p>

<p>Sylvia chased after him.</p>

<p>"Bring it here, Hal! That's a good dog! Bring
it to Missy."</p>

<p>The setter came fawning to her side and unwillingly
dropped his prize at her feet.</p>

<p>As it fell to the ground, out rolled such a glory of
jewels the girl could scarcely believe her eyes.</p>

<p>There was a string of diamonds, dazzling as giant
dewdrops; a pearl and sapphire pendant; several
beautiful rings; and an oval brooch, its emerald centre
surrounded by tier after tier of brilliants.</p>

<p>Sylvia panted, breathless. She had never seen
such gems, much less held them in her hands. How
she longed to slip the rings upon her fingers and try
the effect of the diamonds about her slender throat!</p>

<p>Prudence, however, overmastered the impulse.
Marcia might return and surprise her at any moment.
Before that the treasure must be returned to
the place from which it had been taken.</p>

<p>Gathering the rainbow heap together, she reluctantly
thrust it into its blue leather case, snapped the
catch, and placed it once more under the brick.</p>

<p>Then with relief she stood up and wiped the perspiration
from her forehead.</p>

<p>It was not until she was again in her chair, book
in hand, and struggling to quiet her quick breathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that she discovered she still held in her hand the
handkerchief that had been wrapped about the
jewel-case.</p>

<p>How stupid of her! How insufferably careless!</p>

<p>Well, she dared not attempt to replace it now.
There was no time. Instead, she smoothed it out and
inspected it.</p>

<p>It was a man's handkerchief of finest linen and
one corner bore the embroidered initials S. C. H.</p>

<p>She had known it all the time! There was no
need to be told the jewels were his. What puzzled
her was when he had found time to hide them. He
had not, so far as she knew, been left alone a moment
and yet here was his booty safe beneath the
floor.</p>

<p>She rated it as booty, because there could be no
doubt he had stolen it. He had stolen it from that
Long Island estate, escaped in his speed boat and
here he was&mdash;here, under this very roof!</p>

<p>A robber&mdash;that was what he was!</p>

<p>A robber&mdash;a bandit, such as one saw in the
movies!</p>

<p>That explained why he was so well-dressed, so
handsome, had such fascinating manners. He was a
gentleman burglar.</p>

<p>All up-to-date villains in these days were gentlemen.
Not that she had ever encountered a villain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in the flesh. Still, she had read romances about them
and was there not one in every moving-picture?
They were not difficult to recognize.</p>

<p>Now here she was, actually in the same house with
one! How thrilling! Here was an adventure worthy
of the name. She was not in the least frightened.
On the contrary, from the top of her head to the soles
of her feet she tingled with excitement. She could
feel the hot, pulsing blood throb in her throat and
wrists. It was exhilarating&mdash;wonderful!</p>

<p>Of course Marcia must not know.</p>

<p>She, with her Puritan ideas, would unquestionably
be shocked to discover that the man she was
sheltering was a thief. She would probably feel it
her Christian duty to surrender him to Elisha
Winslow.</p>

<p>How unsuspecting she had been! How naïvely
she had clapped her purse down on the table and proclaimed
exactly where her gold beads were kept!</p>

<p>A thief in the room overhead! Think of it! The
very thief for whom all the police in the countryside
were searching! He was no small, cheap type of
criminal. He did things on a big scale&mdash;so big that
radio announcements had been broadcast about him
and no doubt at this instant detectives and crime inspectors
were chasing up and down the highways;
dashing through cities; and keeping telephone wires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
hot in wild search for the gentleman asleep upstairs!</p>

<p>Sylvia stifled her laughter. The whole thing was
ironic.</p>

<p>Why, that very morning had not Elisha Winslow,
the Wilton sheriff, who had frankly admitted he
yearned for excitement, helped undress the wretch
and put him comfortably to bed? The humor of the
situation almost overcame her.</p>

<p>It seemed as if she must have someone to share
the joke. But no one should. No! Nobody should
be the wiser because of her. The poor, hunted fellow
should have his chance. He was an under-dog
and she had always been romantically sorry for
under-dogs.</p>

<p>It was a little venturesome and risky, she admitted,
to obstruct justice and should she be found
out she would, without doubt, be clapped into jail.
Still she resolved to take a chance.</p>

<p>After all, who could prove she had known Stanley
Heath to be what he was? Nobody. She would not
even let him suspect it.</p>

<p>The important thing was to await an opportunity
and soon&mdash;before he was able to be about&mdash;return
the handkerchief she held in her hand to its place
beneath the brick. Then all would be well. This
should not be difficult. It would be quite easy to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Marcia to take up Mr. Heath's supper.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the situation was intensely
amusing. Its danger appealed to her. She had always
enjoyed hair-breadth escapades. Anything but
dullness. That had been the trouble with Alton
City&mdash;it had been dull&mdash;deadly dull.</p>

<p>But Wilton was not dull. In spite of the fact that
only this morning Elisha Winslow had complained
the town was in need of a stirring up, it seethed with
electricity. If she chose, she could hurl a bomb-shell
into its midst this very minute. But she did not
choose.</p>

<p>Instead she intended to play her own quiet game
and keep what she knew to herself. She wondered
why. Perhaps she was falling in love with this adventurer.
Yes, that must be it. She was in love
with him&mdash;in love with a bandit!</p>

<p>How scandalized Alton City would be! How the
whole town would hold up its hands in horror if it
knew!</p>

<p>Horatio Fuller&mdash;dubbed Hortie because of his
high-hat manners and because his father owned the
largest store in town&mdash;picture his dismay if he
guessed her guilty secret! Perhaps he would shoot
the fellow&mdash;or the fellow shoot him. That was what
usually happened in moving-pictures, somebody always
shot somebody else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>She wouldn't want Hortie to be shot. The thought
of it sobered her. After all, Hortie was a dear, she
liked him&mdash;liked him very much. On the other
hand, she would not want Stanley Heath shot either.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be just as well to leave out all
this shooting, why heap horror upon horror? To be
married to a bandit was adventure enough without
being the wife of a murderer.</p>

<p>Sylvia's imagination had traveled so swiftly and
so far that it came to earth with a crash when Marcia
opened the door.</p>

<p>Her hair, tossed by the wind, clustered about her
face in small, moist ringlets; her cheeks were scarlet,
her eyes shone.</p>

<p>It was not alone the buffeting of the salt breeze
nor the exhilaration of walking against it that had
transformed her into something radiantly lovely.
From within glowed a strange fire that made her
another creature altogether.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;Marcia!" breathed Sylvia, bewildered.</p>

<p>"I've had such a glorious walk, dear!" cried
Marcia. "The fog has lifted and the sky is a sheet
of amethyst and gold."</p>

<p>"Did the men get the boat off?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She is floating tranquilly as a dove."</p>

<p>"What is her name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"<cite>My Unknown Lady.</cite>"</p>

<p>"Mercy on us! That ought to satisfy even
Elisha."</p>

<p>"It did," said Marcia.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VIII" id="Chapter_VIII">Chapter VIII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia's</span> plans, so well laid and apparently so easy
of execution did not, to her chagrin, work out, for
instead of awaking and demanding supper Stanley
Heath slept without a break until morning.</p>

<p>Had not Marcia insisted on leaving her door ajar
lest the invalid call, the girl might have slipped
down stairs in the darkness and returned the handkerchief.</p>

<p>As it was, fate forced her to put it into her bureau
drawer and await more favorable opportunity.</p>

<p>This, alas, did not come.</p>

<p>Sun was tinting the lavender sands to rose and
gilding the water with its first flecks of gold when
she saw Marcia standing at the foot of her bed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Heath has a high fever and can scarcely
speak aloud," explained she. "I'm afraid he is quite
ill. I wish you'd call up Doctor Stetson."</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!"</p>

<p>The girl, drowsy and heavy-eyed, sprang out of
bed.</p>

<p>"I'll be down in just a minute," she exclaimed.
"How do you happen to be up so early?"</p>

<p>"I've been up off and on all night," answered
Marcia. "Mr. Heath was restless and thirsty.
About midnight I heard him tossing about, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thinking he might be hungry, I heated some broth
and took it to him."</p>

<p>"I didn't hear you. I must have been dead to the
world. Why didn't you speak?"</p>

<p>"There was no need of it. You were tired."</p>

<p>"No more than you."</p>

<p>"I was wakeful, anyway. I don't know why.
Perhaps I had him on my mind. If so, it is fortunate,
for he did not call."</p>

<p>"I'm dreadfully sorry he feels so miserable."</p>

<p>"He won't admit it. He declares he is going back
to New York today."</p>

<p>"But he can't&mdash;he mustn't."</p>

<p>"He is determined to. He says he has something
very important to attend to. Of course I have no
authority over him but perhaps Doctor Stetson can
exert some. That is why I am anxious to reach him
before he goes out," explained Marcia, moving
toward the door.</p>

<p>"I will call him right away."</p>

<p>"I'll go down and start breakfast, then. Mr.
Heath is dozing. He has promised not to get up for
at least an hour. We must have the doctor here
within that time."</p>

<p>"I'll tell him to hurry."</p>

<p>Marcia tiptoed down the stairs.</p>

<p>The freshness of early morning was upon the day.
Through the kitchen window pale shafts of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
shot across the floor, brightening the colored rugs
and making brass and copper glisten. Starting the
fire, she threw open the door to let in the salt breeze.</p>

<p>The dampness and chill of the night had disappeared
and the air was mild with the breath of coming
spring. Mingling with the gulls' cries she could
hear the twitter of sparrows and the occasional chirp
of a robin. The village, still hazy in mist, was taking
on sharper outlines and from the bay the voices of
fishermen and the chug of a motor-boat drifted distinctly
across the water.</p>

<p>Prince came bounding into the house from some
distant pilgrimage of his own, almost knocking her
down in his eagerness for breakfast.</p>

<p>She glanced far up the shore and saw, serenely
rocking with the tide, <cite>My Unknown Lady</cite>.</p>

<p>As she whispered the name, she was conscious of
hot blood rushing to her cheeks.</p>

<p>How ridiculous! Stanley Heath was simply a
stranger of a night, he was nothing to her.</p>

<p>Well indeed was it, too, that he was not!</p>

<p>During her hours of sleeplessness the ardor of her
faith in him had, to a degree, cooled. True, she still
maintained her belief in his innocence; but that belief,
she now realized, was only a blind unfounded
intuition. Both the circumstances and sober second
thought failed to back it up. The man's impatience
to be gone, his complete silence with regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the jewels, although perfectly justifiable, did not
strengthen it.</p>

<p>Marcia conceded he had every right to keep his
affairs to himself. She was close-mouthed and
therefore sympathetic with the quality in others.</p>

<p>But such an unusual happening! What more
natural than that one should offer some explanation?</p>

<p>Last night, transported by emotion to a mood
superheroic, she had wished none; nay, more, she
had deliberately placed herself beyond the reach of
it. Today she toppled from her pedestal and became
human, shifting from goddess to woman.</p>

<p>Had Stanley Heath started to confide his secret to
her, she would even now have held up her hand to
stay him.</p>

<p>It was the fact that through the dim hours of the
night, while she sat at his elbow trying to make the
discomforts he suffered more bearable, he talked of
almost everything else but the thing uppermost in
both their minds. That was what hurt. She did not
want to know. She wanted to be trusted; to help;
to feel his dependence upon her. Instead he held her
at arm's length.</p>

<p>Oh, he voiced his gratitude for what she had done.
He did that over and over again, apologizing at having
caused her so much trouble. As if she minded!
Why, she was glad, glad to be troubled!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke with almost an equal measure of appreciation
of the crew who had dragged his boat off the
sand-bar, appearing to consider them also tremendously
kind&mdash;as undoubtedly they were! Still,
they had not begun to come into the close contact
with him that she had.</p>

<p>Marcia caught herself up with a round turn. Here
she was being sensitive, womanish. How detestable!
Why should Stanley Heath pour out his soul to her?
She had never laid eyes on him until yesterday. In
a day or two he would be gone never again to come
into her life. She was glad of it. It was better so.</p>

<p>She had just reached a state of complete tranquillity
and happiness. Why have her serenity stirred
into turmoil and she herself transformed once more
from a free woman to a slave? Her mind should
dwell no more on this man or his affairs. If he decided
to go back to New York today, ill as he was,
she would not attempt to deter him. His business
was his own and he must manage it as he thought
best.</p>

<p>This decision reached, she drew in her chin, lifted
her head a wee bit and began to get the breakfast.</p>

<p>Even Doctor Stetson's arrival and his subsequent
verdict that the patient had bronchitis and would
take his life in his hands should he leave his bed,
afforded her only scant satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>So she was to keep Stanley Heath under her roof
after all&mdash;but against his will. It was not a very
flattering situation.</p>

<p>She sent Sylvia up with his coffee and toast, and
began her usual round of morning duties.</p>

<p>And then just as they were finished and the clock
was striking eleven, he called.</p>

<p>She went up, cheerful but with her head still held
high, and paused on the threshold.</p>

<p>Glancing at her he smiled.</p>

<p>"You look like a bird about to take flight. Won't
you sit down?"</p>

<p>She went nearer. Nevertheless she did not take
the chair he indicated.</p>

<p>"I see you are busy," he said. "I thought perhaps
your housework might be done by this time
and you might have a moment to spare. Well, I
mustn't interrupt. Forgive me for calling."</p>

<p>"I'm not busy."</p>

<p>"You seem hurried."</p>

<p>"I'm not. I haven't a thing in the world to do,"
Marcia burst out.</p>

<p>"Good! Then you can stay a little while," he
coaxed. "Now answer this question truthfully,
please. You heard what Doctor Stetson said about
my returning to New York today. I don't want to
be pig-headed and take a risk if it is imprudent; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is neither fair to others nor to myself. Still, it is
important that I go and I am anxious to. What is
your advice?"</p>

<p>"I think you are too ill."</p>

<p>A frown of annoyance wrinkled his forehead.</p>

<p>"If you will consent to stay where you are a few
days, you will then be all right to go," she added.</p>

<p>Obviously the suggestion did not please him.
However, he answered more mildly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right. Yet for all that I am disappointed.
I want very much to go. It is necessary."</p>

<p>"Can't anything be done from here?" queried
she.</p>

<p>"Such as&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Letters, telegrams&mdash;whatever you wish. I can
telephone or telegraph anywhere. Or I can write."</p>

<p>Surprise stole over his face, then deepened to admiration.</p>

<p>"You would do that for me&mdash;blindfolded?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You know why."</p>

<p>"I simply want to help. I always like to help
when I can," she explained hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Even when you do not understand?"</p>

<p>Piercingly his eyes rested on her face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;do not need to understand," was her
proud retort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>For the fraction of a second, their glances met.
Then she turned away and a pause, broken only by
the crash of the surf on the outer beach, fell between
them.</p>

<p>When at last he spoke his voice was low&mdash;imperative.</p>

<p>"Marcia&mdash;come here!"</p>

<p>She went&mdash;she knew not why.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand."</p>

<p>Again, half-trembling, half reluctant, she obeyed.</p>

<p>He took it in his and bending, kissed it.</p>

<p>"I will stay and you shall telegraph," was all he
said.</p>

<p>She sprang to fetch paper and pencil, as if welcoming
this break in the tension.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I cannot write plainly enough with
my left hand," he said. "Will you take down the
message?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"<cite>Mrs. S. C. Heath</cite>"</p>

<p>Her pencil, so firm only an instant before, quivered.</p>

<p>"Have you that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<cite>The Biltmore, New York City.</cite>"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<cite>Everything safe with me. Do not worry. Marooned
on Cape Cod with cold. Nothing serious.
Home soon. Love. Stanley.</cite>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Got that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Had something gone out of her voice? The monosyllable
was flat, colorless. Heath looked at her.
Even her expression was different&mdash;or did he merely
imagine it?</p>

<p>"Perhaps I would better just glance over the
message before you send it&mdash;simply to make sure
it's right."</p>

<p>"Let me copy it first," she objected.</p>

<p>"Copy it? Nonsense! What for? Nobody's
going to see it."</p>

<p>He reached for the paper.</p>

<p>Still she withheld it.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"It isn't written well enough. I'd rather copy it."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It's wobbly. I&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps my hands were
cold."</p>

<p>"You're not chilly?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no."</p>

<p>"If the room is cool you mustn't stay here."</p>

<p>"It isn't. I'm not cold at all."</p>

<p>"Will you let me take the telegram?"</p>

<p>She placed it in his hand.</p>

<p>"It is shaky. However, that's of no consequence,
since you are to 'phone Western Union. Now, if you
truly are not cold, I'd like to dictate a second wire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"This one is for Currier. <cite>Mr. James Currier, The
Biltmore, New York City. Safe on Cape with
My Lady. Shall return with her later. Motor here
at once, bringing whatever I need for indefinite stay.</cite></p>
<p style="text-indent: 10em;">
<cite>Stanley C. Heath</cite><br />
</p>

<p>"Got that?"</p>

<p>"O.K.," nodded Marcia.</p>

<p>This time, without hesitation, she passed him the
paper.</p>

<p>"This, I see, is your normal hand-writing," he
commented as he placed the messages side by side.
"I must admit it is an improvement on the other."</p>

<p>Taking up the sheets, he studied them with
interest.</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better go and get off the messages?"
suggested Marcia, rising nervously.</p>

<p>"What's your hurry?"</p>

<p>"You said they were important."</p>

<p>"So I did. Nevertheless they can wait a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"The station might be closed. Often it is at noontime."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter if they don't go until afternoon."</p>

<p>"But there might be some slip."</p>

<p>He glanced at her with his keen eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Matter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with you? All of a sudden you've turned
easterly."</p>

<p>"Have I?" Lightly, she laughed. "I probably
have caught the habit from the sea. Environment
does influence character, psychologists say."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you are not fickle."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Even if I were, to change
one's mind is no crime," she went on in the same jesting
tone. "The wind bloweth whither it listeth, and
the good God does not condemn it for doing so."</p>

<p>"But you are not the wind."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," she flashed teasingly. "Or I may
have inherited qualities from the sands that gave me
birth. They are forever shifting."</p>

<p>"You haven't."</p>

<p>"You know an amazing amount about me, seems
to me, considering the length of our acquaintance,"
she observed with a tantalizing smile.</p>

<p>"I do," was the grim retort. "I know more than
you think&mdash;more, perhaps than you know yourself.
Shall I hold the betraying mirror up before you?"</p>

<p>"The mirror of truth? God forbid! Who of us
would dare face it?" she protested, still smiling but
with genuine alarm. "Now do let me run along and
send off the messages. I must not loiter here talking.
You are forgetting that you're ill. The next you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
know your temperature will go up and Doctor Stetson
will blame me."</p>

<p>"My temperature has gone up," growled Stanley
Heath, turning his back on her and burying his face
in the pillow with the touchiness of a small boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_IX" id="Chapter_IX">Chapter IX</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>, meanwhile, had heard Stanley Heath call
Marcia and hailed her aunt's departure from the
kitchen as the opportunity for which she had so
anxiously been waiting.</p>

<p>No sooner was the elder woman upstairs and out
of earshot than she tiptoed from her room, the monogrammed
handkerchief in her pocket.</p>

<p>She had pried out the brick and had the jewel-case
in her hand, wrapped and ready for its return when
conversation overhead suddenly ceased and she heard
Marcia pass through the hall and start down stairs.</p>

<p>Sylvia gasped. She must not be found here. Yet
what was she to do?</p>

<p>There was no chance now to put the package back
and replace the brick which fitted so tightly that its
adjustment was a process requiring patience, care,
and time.</p>

<p>Flustered, frightened, she jammed the jewel-case
into her dress and frantically restoring the brick to
the yawning hole in the hearth as best she could, she
fled up the back stairs at the same moment Marcia
descended the front ones.</p>

<p>Once in her room, she closed and locked the door
and sank panting into a chair to recover her breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, at least she had not been caught and in the
meantime the jewels were quite safe.</p>

<p>Mr. Heath was too ill to be up and about for several
days and until he was able to leave his room
there was not the slightest danger their absence
would be discovered. Long before that time, Marcia
would doubtless go to walk or to the village for mail
and leave her ample opportunity to put the loot back
where Mr. Heath had hidden it.</p>

<p>She took the case stealthily from her pocket.</p>

<p>Now that the gems were in her possession, it certainly
could do no harm for her to look at them&mdash;even
try them on, as she had been tempted to do
when she first discovered them. Probably never
again in all her life would she hold in her hand so
much wealth and beauty. No one, not Heath himself,
could begrudge her a peep at the trinkets.</p>

<p>Accordingly she unwound the handkerchief and
opened the box.</p>

<p>There lay the glistening heap of treasure, resplendent
in the sunshine, a far more gorgeous spectacle
than she had realized.</p>

<p>Going to the bureau, Sylvia took out the jewels,
one by one.</p>

<p>She clasped the diamonds about her neck; fastened
the emerald brooch in place; put on the sapphire
pendant; then added the rings and looked at herself
in the gold-framed mirror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>What she saw reflected dazzled her. Who would
have believed jewels could make such a difference
in one's appearance? They set off her blonde beauty
so that she was suddenly transformed into a princess.</p>

<p>No wonder Stanley Heath had risked his life and
his freedom for spoils such as these!</p>

<p>If she could have only one of the jewels she would
be satisfied&mdash;the string of diamonds, the brooch, a
ring&mdash;which would she choose?</p>

<p>Of course she never could own anything so gorgeous
or so valuable. Notwithstanding the certainty,
however, it was fun to imagine she might.</p>

<p>Slowly, and with conscious coquetry, like a preening
bird, she turned her head this way and that, delighting
in the creaminess of the neck the gems
encircled, and in the fairness of her golden curls.</p>

<p>She really ought to have jewels. She was born
for them and could carry them off. There were myriad
women in the world on whom such adornment
would be wasted&mdash;good and worthy women, too.
Fancy Maria Eldridge or Susan Ann Bearse, for instance,
arrayed in pomp like this! But Marcia would
be magnificent, with her rich complexion, her finely
poised head, her splendid shoulders, her lovely neck.
Marcia dressed in all this wealth would be well worth
looking at.</p>

<p>Then a voice interrupted her reverie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Stanley Heath calling.</p>

<p>She heard Marcia reply and come hurrying upstairs.</p>

<p>Guiltily Sylvia took off her sparkling regalia;
tumbled it unceremoniously into its case; and slipped
it into the drawer underneath a pile of nightdresses.
Then she softly unlocked the door and sauntered out.</p>

<p>It was none too soon, for Marcia was speaking to
her.</p>

<p>"Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How would you feel about going over to the village
for the mail and to do some errands? The tide
is out and you could walk. Prince needs a run."</p>

<p>"I'd love to go."</p>

<p>"That's fine. Here is a list of things we need at
the store. Just be sure not to dally too long and get
marooned over in town."</p>

<p>"I'll watch out."</p>

<p>"You're sure you don't mind going?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I shall enjoy being out."</p>

<p>Then suddenly Sylvia had an inspiration which she
instantly acted upon.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go?" she inquired. "You didn't
sleep much last night, and a walk might do you
good."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't," objected Marcia with haste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"I've a hundred and one things to do."</p>

<p>"Tell me what they are and I'll do them for you."</p>

<p>"I couldn't. They are things I must do myself.
Thanks just the same."</p>

<p>"Well, you know your own business best. Is this
the list?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There are quite a few items, but they won't
be heavy. Here is the basket. Prince will carry it.
That is his job and very proud he is of doing it.
Goodbye, dear."</p>

<p>"She's dreadfully anxious to get us out of the way,
isn't she, Prince?" commented young Sylvia as she
and the setter started out over the sand. "Now what
do you suppose she has on her mind? She's up to
something. Marcia isn't a bit of an actress. She's
too genuine."</p>

<p>Marcia, standing at the window watching the girl
in her blue sweater and matching beret swing along
over the flats mirrored with tiny pools of water, would
have been astonished enough had she heard this
astute observation.</p>

<p>She did want Sylvia out of the way. The girl had
read her correctly.</p>

<p>She must telephone the messages to the station-master
at Sawyer Falls, the adjoining town where
the railroad ended and the nearest telegraph station
was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>She got the line and had no sooner dictated the
telegrams than she heard Heath's voice.</p>

<p>During the interval that had elapsed since she had
left him, both of them had experienced a reaction
and each was eager to make amends.</p>

<p>Marcia regretted her flippancy. It had been childish
of her to give way to pique and punish Heath
simply because it was proved he had a wife. Why
should he not be married? No doubt the absent
Mrs. Stanley Heath was a dashing, sophisticated
beauty, too, who lived in luxury at the great city
hotel to which the first wire had been sent.</p>

<p>Heath had been quite frank about the message
and its destination. On thinking matters over, it
occurred to Marcia he might have considered this the
easiest way to inform her of things he found it embarrassing
to put into words.</p>

<p>She had been made aware in delicate fashion that
he was rich, married and moved in a circle far removed
from the humble one she herself occupied.</p>

<p>No doubt he felt she should realize this.</p>

<p>It regulated their relationship and prevented any
possible misunderstandings.</p>

<p>And she?</p>

<p>Instead of appreciating his honesty, chivalry, gentlemanly
conduct as she should have done, and receiving
it graciously, surprise had betrayed her into
displaying resentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>She was heartily ashamed of herself. No matter
how much it humbled her pride, she must put things
right. Fortunately it was not too late to do so.</p>

<p>Therefore, a very different Marcia Howe responded
to Stanley Heath's summons.</p>

<p>She was now all gentleness, friendliness, and shyly
penitent. If her former coquetry had been bewitching,
this new artless self of hers was a hundredfold
more alluring.</p>

<p>Stanley, again master of himself, welcomed her
with amazement. Could man ever fathom a woman's
moods, he asked himself? Why this chastened and
distractingly adorable Marcia?</p>

<p>It was he who had been in the wrong and given
way to temper, yet instead of demanding the apology
which trembled on his tongue, here she was taking
the blame and passing over his irritability with the
charity of a mother humoring a fretful child.</p>

<p>Well, if he could not fathom her, he at least was
grateful for her understanding.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he did mentally observe he had not
dreamed her to be so many-sided or credited her with
a tithe the fascinations he had so unexpectedly
discovered her to possess.</p>

<p>"Here I am, Mr. Heath. What can I do for you?"
was her greeting.</p>

<p>This time she did not hesitate, but went directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to the chair beside his bed and sat down. He smiled
and, meeting his eyes, she smiled back. This was
better. Heath sighed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking, since you went down stairs,
about Currier. He ought to arrive late tonight or
early tomorrow morning. He will start the moment
he gets my wire. Although he will not know in which
house I am quartered, he will have the wit to inquire,
for he has more than the ordinary quota of brains.
I don't know what I should do without him. He has
been with me for years and is an Admirable Crichton
and a good man Friday rolled into one. I shall have
him leave the car in the village and after he has delivered
over the clothing he is to bring, he can take
the noon train back to New York, carrying the jewels
with him."</p>

<p>"I see," nodded Marcia.</p>

<p>She did not see.</p>

<p>She did not understand any of the snarl of events
in which so unwittingly she found herself entangled.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she heartily welcomed the intelligence
that the jewels with their damning evidence,
if evidence it was, were to be removed from the
house. The sooner they were out of the way the
better. If they were not damning evidence they at
least were a great responsibility.</p>

<p>Suppose something were to happen to them? Sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>pose somebody suspected they were in the house?</p>

<p>The thought had occurred to her more than once.</p>

<p>"So," continued Stanley Heath, "I think sometime
today when you have a good opportunity you'd
better get the case and bring it up here. I shall then
have it here in my room and I can hand it over to
Currier without any trouble."</p>

<p>"I'll go and fetch it now. Sylvia has gone to the
village and this is a splendid chance," cried Marcia.</p>

<p>"Fine!"</p>

<p>"I'll be right back."</p>

<p>He heard her speed down the stairs and listened to
her step in the room below.</p>

<p>Then there was silence.</p>

<p>A few moments later she came racing back, white
and breathless.</p>

<p>"They're gone!" she cried. "The place is empty!
The jewels are not there!"</p>

<p>Her terror and the fear lest her pallor foreshadowed
collapse produced in Heath that artificial calm one
sometimes sees when a strong nature reins itself in
and calls upon its reserve control.</p>

<p>Marcia had fallen to her knees beside the bed and
buried her face, trembling with agitation.</p>

<p>The man thought only of how to quiet her. Reaching
out, he touched her hair.</p>

<p>"Hush, Marcia. The jewels will be found. Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
give way like this. I cannot bear to see you. The
whole lot of them are not worth your tears."</p>

<p>"But you left them in my care. It was I who suggested
where to hide them," she moaned.</p>

<p>"I know. And it was a splendid idea, too. Besides,
we had no time to hunt hiding-places. We
were forced to act right away. I could not let that
sheriff of yours peel off my clothes and find the diamonds
on me. He isn't a man of sufficient imagination&mdash;or
perhaps he is one of far too much. I am
not blaming you,&mdash;not in the least. We did the best
we could in the emergency. If things have gone
wrong, it is no fault of yours."</p>

<p>"But you trusted me. I ought to have watched.
I should not have left the kitchen day or night,"
declared Marcia, lifting her tear-stained face to his.</p>

<p>"You have been there most of the time, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"I went to see them get the boat off yesterday."</p>

<p>"Still, someone was here. Sylvia was in the
house."</p>

<p>"Yes, but she knew nothing about the jewels and
therefore may not have realized the importance of
staying on deck. How could she, unless she had been
warned? All I asked her to do was to remain within
call. She may have gone upstairs, or into another
room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"When she comes back, you can ask her."</p>

<p>It was he who now soothed and cheered, his caressing
hand moving from her shoulder down her arm
until her fingers lay in his.</p>

<p>Convulsively she caught and clung to them.</p>

<p>"Now we must pull ourselves together, dear," went
on Stanley gently. "It is important that we do not
give ourselves away. Sylvia may know nothing and
if she does not, we must not let her suspect. The
fewer people there are mixed up in this dilemma the
better."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She rose but he still held her hand, a common
misery routing every thought of conventionality.</p>

<p>The firmness and magnetism of his touch brought
strength. It was a new experience, for during her life
with Jason, Marcia had been the oak&mdash;the one who
consoled, sustained. For a few delicious moments,
she let herself rest, weary and unresisting, within the
shelter of Stanley Heath's grasp. Then she drew
away and, passing her hand across her forehead as if
awaking from a dream murmured:</p>

<p>"I'd better go down. Sylvia will be coming."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now keep a stiff upper lip. Remember,
I depend on you to see the apple-cart does not
upset."</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;I'll do my best."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Even as she spoke the outer door opened, then
closed with a bang.</p>

<p>"There's Sylvia now. I must go."</p>

<p>The girl came in, aglow from her walk.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry I banged the door," she apologized.
"A gust of wind took it. I do hope I didn't
wake up Mr. Heath. Here's the marketing. I
thought I should never get out of that store. Everybody
in the whole town was there for mail and I had
to stop and tell each one all about Mr. Heath and his
shipwreck, his boat and his health. I must have
answered a million questions. People are dreadfully
curious about him.</p>

<p>"And Marcia, what do you suppose? I had a letter
from Hortie Fuller&mdash;that fellow back home that
I've told you about. He's sent me a five-pound box
of candy and he wants to come to Wilton and spend
his summer vacation."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes were shining and she breathed
quickly.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't care a button for Hortie. Still,
it would be rather good fun to see him. He always
dropped in every day when I was at home. It seems
ages since I've laid eyes on him. You know how it
is&mdash;you get used to a person who is always under
foot. You have to think about him if only to avoid
stepping on him. And after all, Hortie isn't so bad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Thinking him over from a distance, he really is rather
nice. Come and sample the candy. It's wonderful.
He must have blown himself and sent to Chicago for
it, poor dear! I suppose Eben Snow read the address,
because he called out 'Guess you've got a beau out
West, Miss Sylvia.' Everybody heard him and I
thought I should go through the floor. He looked the
letter all over, too. I'll let you see the letter, all except
the part which is too frightfully silly. You
wouldn't care about that. I don't myself."</p>

<p>Sylvia shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>Alas, this was no moment to talk with her, and artfully
draw from her the happenings of the previous
day.</p>

<p>Inwardly distraught but outwardly calm, Marcia
took the letter and tried valiantly to focus her attention
upon it.</p>

<p>To her surprise, it was a manly, intelligent letter,
filled with town gossip, to be sure, yet written in delightfully
interesting fashion.</p>

<p>"Your Mr. Fuller sounds charming," she said as
she gave it back.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hortie is all right&mdash;in some ways." Patronizingly
slipping the letter into her pocket, Sylvia
shifted the subject. Nevertheless, a betraying flush
colored her cheeks. "Now we must start dinner,
mustn't we? See, it's noon already. I had no idea
it was so late."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>She tossed her hat into a chair.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to ask Mr. Heath which way he
prefers his eggs&mdash;poached or boiled? I suppose
with a temperature, he isn't going to be allowed anything
but simple food. And Marcia, while you're
there, do put a pair of fresh pillow-slips on his pillows.
The ones he has are frightfully tumbled. I
meant to do it this morning."</p>

<p>As the door closed behind the elder woman, artful
young Sylvia smiled.</p>

<p>"There! That will keep her busy for a few moments
at least. I know those pillow-cases. They
fit like a snake's skin and are terribly hard to get off
and on."</p>

<p>She crept into the hall and listened.</p>

<p>Yes, Marcia and Stanley Heath were talking. She
could hear her aunt's gentle insistence and the man's
protests. That was all she wished to know. The
pillow-cases were in process of being taken off.</p>

<p>Up the stairs flew Sylvia, to return a second later,
the jewel-case swathed in its loose wrappings.</p>

<p>"If I can only scramble it in there before she
comes," whispered she. "I shall draw the first long
breath I've taken since last night. I wouldn't own
those things if they were given me. They would
worry me into my grave."</p>

<p>An anxious interval elapsed before the brick was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
pried out and the case slipped beneath it. Nevertheless
the feat was accomplished and triumphant,
relieved, happy Sylvia set about preparing dinner.</p>

<p>She even ventured to hum softly that when Marcia
returned she might find her entirely serene.</p>

<p>"Mr. Heath, alas, will never know how becoming
his jewelry was to me," she mused. "Had a Hollywood
producer seen me, he would have snapped me
up for a movie star within ten minutes. I certainly
looked the part."</p>

<p>What a long while Marcia was staying upstairs!
Why, one could change a dozen pillow-slips in this
time.</p>

<p>"I guess they are tighter than I remembered them.
I needn't have rushed as I did," pouted Sylvia.
"What can she be doing?"</p>

<p>When at last Marcia returned, something evidently
was wrong.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Sylvia. "Is Mr.
Heath worse?"</p>

<p>"Worse? No indeed. What made you think so?"</p>

<p>"You look fussed."</p>

<p>"Do I? You'd be fussed had you wrestled with
those pillow-slips as I have," was the reply. "Either
the pillows have swelled or the cases have shrunk
frightfully. Well, they are on now, anyway."</p>

<p>"Come and get dinner then. I'm starved. My
walk has made me hungry as a bear. You must go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
out this afternoon, Marcia. It is a glorious day and
you need to be pepped up. I know what staying in
the house means. Didn't I sit in this kitchen all yesterday
afternoon until I got so dopey I could scarcely
keep my eyes open? Not that I wasn't glad to," she
added hastily. "I never mind staying in when there
is a reason for doing it, and of course I want to do my
bit toward taking care of Mr. Heath. Still, indoors
isn't the same as outdoors. We all need exercise.
I've had my quota for the day. You must have
yours."</p>

<p>To her surprise, Marcia demurred.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear, but I think I won't go out
today."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel like it. I'd rather sit here and read."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Marcia! You're getting middle-aged
and lazy. You'll lose your nice slim, hipless figure
if you don't watch out."</p>

<p>"I guess I shan't lose it today. Soon Mr. Heath
will be gone and we can both go."</p>

<p>"But I can play nurse for the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I'm too tired to go out."</p>

<p>"The air would rest you."</p>

<p>"Not today, dear," Marcia said with finality. "I
have some mending to do and lots of other little
things that I have been saving up for a long time.
Since I prefer to stay, why don't you tramp up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
shore and see <cite>My Unknown Lady</cite>? She is beautiful
and you haven't seen her yet."</p>

<p>"I'd love to&mdash;if I cannot coax you to go out."</p>

<p>"You can't. I'm adamant on not stirring out of
this room."</p>

<p>"Well, if your mind is made up to that extent, I
suppose there is no use in my trying to change it. I
would like to see the boat."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you would. Stay as long as you like.
There will be nothing to do here. Somebody ought
to enjoy the sunshine and blue sky. Mr. Heath will
probably sleep and in the meantime I shall get my
sewing done."</p>

<p>As Marcia spoke the words, her mind was busy.</p>

<p>So Sylvia had not stirred from the kitchen on the
previous afternoon! The theft of the jewels must,
then, have taken place during the night.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was puzzled, for she had no
memory of finding anything awry when she came
down at sunrise to lay the fire.</p>

<p>Moreover, she now recalled she had been in the
kitchen several times during the night, heating soup
and getting water for Stanley Heath.</p>

<p>There had been nothing wrong then, at least she
had noticed nothing.</p>

<p>When had the gems been taken, and who had taken
them? No wonder she craved solitude to ponder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the conundrum! This, however, was not the paramount
reason she desired to be alone.</p>

<p>Despite the enigma of the jewels; despite the mystery
surrounding Stanley Heath, deep in her heart
something that would not be stilled was singing&mdash;singing!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_X" id="Chapter_X">Chapter X</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the meantime, the throng of neighbors Sylvia had
precipitately left in the village post office had received
their mail and reached that anticipated interval
for gossip which never failed to be stimulating.</p>

<p>Clustered about the counter loitered the standbys.</p>

<p>Zenas Henry was speaking:</p>

<p>"A mighty fine little girl&mdash;that Sylvia," commented
he. "A high stepper! We'd oughter tie her
down to Wilton so'st she won't go back West. She's
too pretty to be spared from the Cape."</p>

<p>"I figger you'd have trouble keepin' her here," rejoined
Silas Nickerson, the postmaster, sauntering
out from his wicker cage. "She's got a beau in her
home town. Had a letter an' a box of candy from
him today. Same writin' an' same postmark on both
of 'em, I noticed. She blushed red as a peony when I
passed 'em out to her."</p>

<p>"Didn't by any chance see the name, did you,
Silas?" Eleazer Crocker inquired.</p>

<p>"Wal, come to think of it, it did catch my eye.
You know how such things will. Fuller, he's called.
Horatio Fuller."</p>

<p>"Horatio Fuller, eh?" Eleazer repeated. "Kinder
high soundin'. Wonder who he is? From Alton
City, you say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Silas nodded.</p>

<p>"That was the address."</p>

<p>"Never heard of the place," Captain Benjamin
Todd put in.</p>

<p>"That don't in no way prevent its existin', Ben,"
answered Zenas Henry with his customary drawl.</p>

<p>"If we had a map handy we might look it up,"
suggested Captain Phineas Taylor. "I'd like to see
just where it's located."</p>

<p>"I tried doin' that," the postmaster admitted. "I
got out my map, but the place warn't on it."</p>

<p>"No wonder I never heard of it!" blustered Benjamin
Todd.</p>

<p>"That don't prove nothin', Benjamin," his friend
Phineas Taylor expostulated. "Silas's map was
drawed before the flood. Even Wilton ain't on it."</p>

<p>"It ain't?"</p>

<p>A simultaneous gasp rose from the assembly.</p>

<p>"Then all I can say is it's a darn poor map," Enoch
Morton sniffed. "A map that ain't got Wilton on it
might as well be burned. 'Tain't worth botherin'
with."</p>

<p>"It's all the map I've got," Silas apologized.</p>

<p>"You'd oughter ask the government for another.
Why don't you write to Washington, explainin' that
neither Wilton nor Alton City are on this one an' ask
'em for a better one?"</p>

<p>"'Fore you start complainin', you might make sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Belleport's down," suggested Lemuel Gill, a resident
of the adjoining village. "Last I knew, that warn't
on this map, neither."</p>

<p>"'Twarn't?"</p>

<p>"Who makes these maps, I wonder?" bristled
Zenas Henry. "Some numskull who ain't traveled
none, I'll bet a hat. Why don't he go round an' see
what places there is 'fore he starts map-makin'?
Why, any one of us knows more 'bout the job already
than he does. We know there's Belleport, an' Wilton,
an' Alton City."</p>

<p>"Bet you couldn't tell what state Alton City is in,
though, Zenas Henry," Silas challenged.</p>

<p>"Alton City? Let me think! Alton City!"
Thoughtfully he stroked his chin. "'Tain't my
business to know where 'tis," he presently sputtered.
"If everybody knew where all the blasted places in
the country were, what use would they have for
maps? 'Twould put the map-makin' folks clean out
of business."</p>

<p>"If map-makers don't know where Wilton an'
Belleport are they'd better be out of business, in my
opinion," countered Benjamin Todd. "Say, Ephraim,"
he exclaimed, inspired by a bright idea,
"you're the mail carrier. You'd oughter be primed
on the location of places. Where's Alton City?"</p>

<p>"Alton City? Hanged if I know. To hear you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
talk, anybody'd think 'twas my job to tote round the
country deliverin' letters in person at the doors of
every house in the United States."</p>

<p>"But you must have some notion 'bout geography.
Ain't you got no pocket atlas nor nothin'?"</p>

<p>"I may have a small map somewheres; I carry
most everything," Ephraim grinned. With deliberation,
he began to disgorge upon the counter the contents
of his many pockets.</p>

<p>There was a tangle of pink string; two stumpy
pencils without points; a fragment of fish-line; a
soiled scrap of court-plaster; a box of matches; a
plug of tobacco; a red bandanna handkerchief; three
cough-drops, moist and sticky; several screws; a
worn tube of paste; a jack-knife.</p>

<p>"My soul, Eph!" ejaculated Zenas Henry.
"You're a reg'lar travelin' junk shop, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"I have to have things by me."</p>

<p>"Was you Robinson Crusoe, you'd never have call
for any such mess of truck as this. Where's the
map?"</p>

<p>"Must be in my breast pocket," replied the mail-carrier,
thrusting his hand inside his pea-coat. "My
eye! If I ain't forgot that telegram!" he abruptly
exclaimed. "The station-master at Sawyer Falls
gave it to me when he handed out the mail. It clean
went out of my mind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"A telegram!" came in chorus from his audience.
"Who for?"</p>

<p>"It's for that chap Heath who's stayin' over at
The Widder's."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you been wool-gatherin' you might 'a'
given it to Sylvia to take back with her. She was
here only a little while ago," Silas Nickerson said.</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"S'pose I was to take it over," Elisha Winslow
suggested eagerly. "I'm willin' to."</p>

<p>"Fur's that goes, I can carry it," Captain Phineas
Taylor piped.</p>

<p>"Give it to me, Eph, an' I'll see it's landed there
within half an hour," proposed Benjamin Todd, elbowing
his way forward.</p>

<p>"Now there's no use in all you fellers volunteerin',"
Eleazer Crocker asserted. "I'm goin'
straight over to Marcia's, as it happens, soon's I've
et my dinner, an' I'll take the telegram."</p>

<p>With an air of authority, he held out his hand.</p>

<p>The crowd fell back.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding their acquiescence, Zenas
Henry, not to be awed into subjection, had the temerity
to add:</p>

<p>"Remember, though, Eleazer, you ain't to go off
the mainland without leavin' the key to the engine-house
where we can get it. We've no hankerin' to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
burnt alive while you're philanderin' at The Widder's."</p>

<p>"Hang it on the peg inside Benjamin Todd's fish
shanty as you go by," called another voice.</p>

<p>"I'll do that," Eleazer agreed as he pocketed the
telegram.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Early afternoon found Marcia alone in the Homestead
sitting-room.</p>

<p>A driftwood fire flickered upon the hearth, for
although spring was on the way, the large, high-studded
rooms were not yet entirely free of winter's
chill and dampness.</p>

<p>Sylvia had gone up the beach. Stanley Heath
was asleep; and at last the delicious interval of solitude
which the woman coveted was here.</p>

<p>The basket at her elbow overflowed with mending,
but she had not yet taken up her needle.</p>

<p>Instead she sat motionless before the blaze, dreamily
watching the vivid blues and greens as they
flared up into the glow of the flame there to blend
with its splendor, and afterwards melt into embers
of scarlet and orange.</p>

<p>She could not work.</p>

<p>Try as she would, her mind wandered off into by-ways
too fascinating to be resisted&mdash;by-ways which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
no matter how remote their windings, invariably led
her back to Stanley Heath.</p>

<p>In retrospect she lived over again every incident,
every word, every look that had passed between
them until she came to the barrier of the unknown
which her fancy bridged with intricate rainbow-hued
imaginings.</p>

<p>While the fire crackled and flashes of sapphire and
emerald shot up and died away, she twisted possible
explanations this way and that and would contentedly
have continued the pastime had not Eleazer
Crocker knocked at the door.</p>

<p>Eleazer could not have chosen a more inopportune
moment to drag her back to earth.</p>

<p>With a frown and a deep sigh, Marcia went reluctantly
to let him in.</p>

<p>"Wal, now ain't it nice to find you by yourself!"
was his greeting. "The kitchen looks cozy as can
be. Spring may be comin' but for all that cool
weather still hangs on. Where was you settin'?"</p>

<p>"I was in the front room, but perhaps we better
drop down here so I can listen in case Mr. Heath
should call."</p>

<p>"Anywhere you say. Wherever you are suits
me."</p>

<p>"I'll just run in and put the screen round the fire
and get my mending," Marcia replied a trifle uneasily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me go."</p>

<p>"No, indeed. You wait here. I'll be right back."</p>

<p>Left to himself, Eleazer smiled a smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The kitchen was warm, Marcia was alone and apparently
not busy. Could circumstances be more
propitious? Fortune certainly was with him. Today,
this very afternoon, he would take his future in
his hands and put to her the question he had so often
determined to put.</p>

<p>Times without number he had mentally rehearsed
what he meant to say. In fact he habitually fell into
this intriguing dialogue whenever he had nothing
else to occupy him. It commenced with a few preliminary
observations concerning the weather, the
springtime, the birds&mdash;the birds who would soon
be mating. That was the keynote&mdash;mating. The
rest followed very naturally. It was, Eleazer felt, a
neat, in fact quite a poetic proposal.</p>

<p>He cleared his throat in preparation.</p>

<p>When Marcia came back, he was primed and
ready to begin his declaration.</p>

<p>"Weather's been fine, ain't it?" he started out.</p>

<p>Marcia took up her sewing.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" questioned she, raising her
brows. "Seems to me we've had lots of rain and
fog."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wal, yes, now you mention it I do recall a few
thick days. Still, spring is comin'."</p>

<p>"I'd like to shingle the south ell this spring," announced
Marcia, giving a disconcertingly practical
twist to the conversation. "How many shingles do
you suppose it would take?"</p>

<p>Eleazer frowned.</p>

<p>The dialogue was not proceeding along the lines
he had mapped out.</p>

<p>Determined to fetter it and bring it back into the
prescribed channels, he answered:</p>

<p>"I'd have to reckon that out. It's a good notion,
though, to make the ell tight. That's what the birds
are doin'."</p>

<p>Astonished, Marcia glanced up from her work.</p>

<p>"I mean," floundered on Eleazer, "they're gettin'
their nests built an' kinder pickin' out their mates.
Pickin' the right mate's quite a job for some folks."</p>

<p>He saw Marcia turn scarlet. Mercy! What a
slip! She thought he was twitting her about Jason.</p>

<p>"What I set out to say was that when you get the
wrong mate you know it," he countered hastily.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, were the words out of his
mouth than he saw they were no better.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be well to abandon the mating
question and start on a new tack. He had tried the
spring. Suppose he took summer as his theme?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Summer's a nice season, ain't it?" ventured he.</p>

<p>"Yes, although I never enjoy it as much as the
other months. I don't like the heat and I detest the
summer boarders."</p>

<p>Eleazer swallowed hard. He would better have
clung to the spring. He saw that now. He would
retrace his steps.</p>

<p>"Spring is nice," he agreed. "With the birds
a-buildin' their nests, an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>At last he was back on familiar ground.</p>

<p>"I did not realize you were so much interested in
birds, Eleazer," Marcia exclaimed. "I have a fine
bird book I must lend you. It's in the other room.
I'll fetch it."</p>

<p>Springing up, she disappeared.</p>

<p>"Drat it!" murmured Eleazer. "Could anything
be more exasperatin'? An' me neither knowin'
nor carin' a hang whether a bird's a robin or a sparrow.
Just when I was gettin' the way paved so nice,
too." He wandered to the window. "Oh, heavens,
who's this comin'? If it ain't 'Lish Winslow! Now
what in thunder does he want, buttin' in? He's
walkin' like as if the evil one was at his heels."</p>

<p>Eleazer threw open the door.</p>

<p>Before he could speak, however, Elisha puffing
and out of breath bawled:</p>

<p>"Where in the name of goodness did you put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
engine-house key, Eleazer? Whipple's hen house is
afire an' we've hunted high an' low for it."</p>

<p>Eleazer purpled.</p>

<p>"My soul an' body," he gasped. "I clean forgot
to leave it. Must be here in my pocket."</p>

<p>Wildly he began to search.</p>

<p>"You're a fine head of the fire department, you
are!" roared Elisha. "If you'd put your mind on
town business 'stead of on Marcia Howe, we'd all be
better off. Traipsing over here to see her in the
middle of the day, palmin' off that telegram as an
excuse&mdash;"</p>

<p>If Eleazer had been purple before, he was livid
now.</p>

<p>"Well, you better go straight back to the village
fast as you can leg it an' carry the key with you,"
went on the accuser. "Don't wait for nothin'. I'll
explain matters to Marcia."</p>

<p>"But I've got to see her. I've got to speak to her
private," protested the wretched official.</p>

<p>"Private? Ain't you been talkin' to her private
an' hour or more? What else have you got to say
to her?"</p>

<p>"I want to give her somethin'."</p>

<p>"Give it to me. I'll hand it to her."</p>

<p>Elisha's extended palm was not to be ignored.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this&mdash;telegram," quavered Eleazer. "I
ain't had a chance to&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you ain't given her that
telegram yet?"</p>

<p>"I was intendin' to. I was just about to when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wal, of all the&mdash;" words failed Elisha. "Here,
give it to me," he commanded. "I can be depended
on to deliver messages if you can't. I'll see she has
it. In the meantime, the best thing you can do is to
hoof it to town quick's ever you can. If the whole
place ain't burned to the ground an' if they don't tar
an' feather you when you put in your appearance,
you'll be lucky."</p>

<p>"Ain't you comin'?"</p>

<p>"I? No. Fire's ain't in my line. Long's Marcia's
here by herself an' ain't busy, I'm goin' to pay her a
call," Elisha grinned. "I've got to deliver the telegram."</p>

<p>"Still, you don't need to stay," pleaded Eleazer,
facing his triumphant rival.</p>

<p>"Mebbe I do," was Elisha's hectoring retort.
"Mebbe this is the very time for me to linger behind.
The coast's clear. Why shouldn't I stay?"</p>

<p>"You might be needed at the fire."</p>

<p>"I shan't be," was the calm reply. "Not unless
there's somethin' criminal about it."</p>

<p>"It might be arson."</p>

<p>"I'll take a chance on it startin' from Dan Whipple's
cigarette. In fact he owned as much. Dan's
terrible careless with his cigarettes. Now, hop along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Eleazer, else the whole conflagration will be out 'fore
you get there."</p>

<p>The unlucky fire-chief had no choice.</p>

<p>"Drat it!" raged he, as he strode off across the
sand. "Drat it! Ain't that just my luck!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_XI" id="Chapter_XI">Chapter XI</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Either</span> the book for which Marcia searched was not
to be found or she was in no haste to return to her
awaiting suitor.</p>

<p>Whatever the explanation, her absence lengthened
from a few moments into a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>In the meantime Elisha, like his predecessor, was
formulating his mode of attack.</p>

<p>Eleazer, apparently, had not been successful.</p>

<p>Might not this be his own golden opportunity?</p>

<p>Before another snatched the prize from him; before
Heath with his yacht and his monogrammed
silken garments recovered his strength, he would put
his fate to the test.</p>

<p>Women were unaccountable creatures.</p>

<p>You never could predict what they might do.</p>

<p>Smoothing a man's pillow and feeding broth to
him sometimes brought about surprising results.</p>

<p>Furthermore, thus far no one had been able to find
out how well Marcia really knew this Stanley Heath.
Perhaps a romance of long standing, of which the
village was ignorant, existed between them.</p>

<p>Who could tell?</p>

<p>In any case, it behooved an aspirant for the hand
of this matchless creature to put in his claim without
delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Elisha wandered about the empty kitchen, mentally
summing up the situation.</p>

<p>He had a small deposit in the bank which, added
to Marcia's larger fortune, would provide sumptuously
for his old age. In addition, if she became his
wife she would, of course, do the cooking and housework
and he could dismiss May Ellen Howard, his
housekeeper, thereby saving her salary.</p>

<p>As to a house, he could not quite decide whether
it would be wiser to take up residence in the Homestead
or continue to live in his own smaller abode in
Wilton. The Homestead undoubtedly was finer and
more pretentious, but it was large and probably expensive
to heat. Furthermore, its location was
breezy and draughts always aggravated his rheumatism.
If it could be sold, it should net a neat sum.</p>

<p>Well, he need not decide these questions now.
There would be time enough to smooth out all such
trivial details after the wedding.</p>

<p>He strolled up to the stove and, standing on the
hearth with his back to the fire, rocked back and
forth on his heels reflectively.</p>

<p>As he did so, a brick beneath his feet rocked with
him.</p>

<p>Elisha looked down.</p>

<p>He saw it was quite loose.</p>

<p>"That thing's goin' to trip up somebody some fine
day," commented he. "It oughter be cemented."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>He stooped to investigate.</p>

<p>It was then he noticed for the first time an edge of
linen projecting above the masonry.</p>

<p>"Marcia must 'a' stuffed a rag in there to keep the
thing from wobblin'," he mused. "Ain't that like a
woman? She ain't helped matters none, neither. It
wobbles just the same. I can fix it better'n that."</p>

<p>Producing his knife, Elisha pried the brick from
its place.</p>

<p>As he lifted it out, a handkerchief came with it
disgorging at his feet a flat, blue leather case.</p>

<p>If the sheriff's eyes bulged when he caught sight
of it, they all but popped from his head when, egged
on by curiosity, he pressed the catch on the box.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash the whole situation clarified in his
mind.</p>

<p>These were the widely heralded Long Island
jewels; and the thief who had stolen them was here
beneath this roof!</p>

<p>It was plain as a pikestaff. Hidden by fog he had
escaped in his boat and inadvertently run aground at
the mouth of Wilton Harbor.</p>

<p>Of course Marcia did not know. Even though a
friendship existed between herself and Heath, she
was unquestionably ignorant of the nefarious means
by which he earned his living.</p>

<p>Far from cherishing anger or resentment toward
the person who exposed his villainy and prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
her from sacrificing herself to such an unprincipled
adventurer, would she not regard her rescuer with
deepest gratitude? Elisha's head whirled.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, confused though he was, it was clear
to him he must not make a misstep and neglect to
perform his official duty with dignity.</p>

<p>Heath was ill. There would be no danger of his
leaving the Homestead at present, especially as he
had no suspicion the jewels had been discovered.</p>

<p>The best plan was for him to return to the mainland;
get his badge and handcuffs; find out what
formalities such a momentous event as an arrest demanded;
and return later and round up the
criminal.</p>

<p>He did not dally. Carefully putting the gems back
where he had found them, he placed the telegram
upon the table and went out, softly closing the door
behind him.</p>

<p>It flashed into his mind that as the tide was coming
in it might be well to borrow Marcia's boat and
row back to shore.</p>

<p>This would serve two purposes. He would reach
home sooner; and Heath, cut off by the sweep of the
channel, would in the meantime be unable to escape.</p>

<p>Elisha rubbed his hands. He was pretty farsighted&mdash;pretty
cute. In fact, his management of
this affair was going to put a big feather in his cap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
He could see now his name emblazoned on the front
pages of the papers:</p>

<p><cite>Elisha Winslow, Wilton sheriff, makes daring arrest!
Cape official rounds up gem thief!</cite></p>

<p>All over the country people would read that it was
he who had tracked down this notorious criminal.</p>

<p>And the police&mdash;those brass-buttoned city men
who rated themselves so high and looked down on
village constables and sheriffs as if they were the dirt
beneath their feet&mdash;they would be given a lesson
they would remember!</p>

<p>They would be pretty sore about it, too, when they
found the glory of making this capture going to a
small-town deputy.</p>

<p>Never had Elisha rowed as he rowed that day!
The dory fairly leaped through the water. Reaching
shore, he sprang from it and dragged it up on the
sand. Then, trembling with excitement, he set out
for home.</p>

<p>Everything must be done in ship-shape fashion.
There must be no bungling&mdash;no slips that would
detract from the dignity of the event. He was almost
at his gate when to his consternation he saw Eleazer
puffing after him.</p>

<p>"You didn't make much of a stop at The Widder's,
I see," jeered he.</p>

<p>"No. Had other business," came crisply from
Elisha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't say! I can't imagine your havin' business
important enough to cut short a call on Marcia
Howe. Mebbe she didn't urge you to loiter."</p>

<p>"I didn't see Marcia. I come away 'fore she got
back," snapped the sheriff.</p>

<p>Unbelievingly, Eleazer scanned his countenance.</p>

<p>"You 'pear to be kinder stirred up, 'Lish," he commented.
"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Elisha determined upon a sudden and bold move.</p>

<p>"Say, Eleazer," began he cautiously, "was you
ever at an arrest?"</p>

<p>"An arrest!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you ever see a man arrested?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I dunno as I ever did&mdash;not really. I've
seen it done, though, in the movies."</p>

<p>"That oughter be up-to-date an' proper. Just
how was the proceedin' put through?"</p>

<p>Thoughtfully Eleazer regarded the toes of his
boots.</p>

<p>"Wal, near's I can recollect, the policeman went
up to the criminal an' grabbin' him by the arm says:
'You villain! I've got you now. Scram!' I ain't
exactly positive he says Scram at that precise minute,
but in all such scenes, somebody always says
Scram to somebody else 'fore the mix-up is through.
That, in the main, is what happens."</p>

<p>"I s'pose the policeman wore a badge an' carried
handcuffs."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, law, yes. But what's the game? What do
you want to know for?"</p>

<p>Furtively Elisha glanced up and down the empty
road and after peering over his shoulder, he dropped
his voice to a confidential whisper and hissed:</p>

<p>"'Cause I'm goin' to make an arrest&mdash;a big arrest!
I've tracked down the thief that committed
the Long Island burglary. Moreover, I know this
very second where the jewels are."</p>

<p>Eleazer's jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to 'phone the New York police I've got
their man," he concluded, drawing himself to his full
height and expanding his chest until the buttons on
his coat threatened to burst off.</p>

<p>"You be? My soul an' body!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm goin' to call long distance straight
away."</p>

<p>Eleazer's cunning mind worked quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, 'Lish, as I'd do that," he cautioned.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Wal, in the first place, you might be mistook in
your calculations an' not only get yourself into hot
water but make the town a laughin' stock. Furthermore,
was you wrong, you might get sued for defamin'
the accused's character."</p>

<p>"I ain't wrong. I'm right."</p>

<p>"Wal, even so, I'd move careful," urged his com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>panion. "Most likely there's a reward out for this
criminal. Why split it with a host of others? Why
don't you an' me divide it? I'll help you land your
man, since you're a bit&mdash;" Eleazer, fearing to offend,
hesitated, "&mdash;a bit out of practice 'bout arrestin'."</p>

<p>The advice was good. Elisha, shrewd in his dealings,
instantly saw the advantages of the plan proposed.</p>

<p>"Wal, mebbe 'twould be better if I didn't let too
many ignorant city chaps in on a big thing like this,"
he conceded pompously. "You an' me know what
we're about. I figger we could handle it."</p>

<p>"Sure we could. We can put it through in first-class
shape. First you must change your ole clothes
for your Sunday ones. A black frock coat's what
you really oughter wear. I wish we dared borrow
the minister's. Still, I reckon your Sunday suit'll
do. Then you must pin your sheriff's badge on your
chest where it'll show good an' plain. Be sure to
bring along your handcuffs, 'cause you're certain to
need 'em with an experienced criminal such as this.
He won't have no mind to be took up. He'll have a
gun an' put up a fight."</p>

<p>"Have a gun?"</p>

<p>"Sure he'll have a gun! In fact he'll prob'ly have
several of 'em."</p>

<p>Elisha paled and a tremor twitched his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"That needn't concern you none, though. All
you'll have to do will be to steal up behind him, put
your pistol 'twixt his shoulder-blades an' shout:
'Stick 'em up!'"</p>

<p>"Stick 'em up?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Stick what up?"</p>

<p>"His hands, man&mdash;his hands," explained Eleazer
impatiently.</p>

<p>"I ain't got no pistol."</p>

<p>"For the land's sake! You ain't got a pistol?
You&mdash;a sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Somehow I never got round to purchasin' a pistol,"
Elisha apologized. "I ain't fond of fire-arms.
In fact, I don't know's I ever shot off a revolver in
my life."</p>

<p>"Wal, I have. I've shot dozens of skunks."</p>

<p>"You might lend me yours."</p>

<p>"I s'pose I might. It ain't, though, workin' very
well right now. It's kinder rusty. Furthermore,
I'm out of ammunition."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't matter. I ain't calculatin' to
fire it."</p>

<p>"But you'll have to."</p>

<p>Elisha's mounting disapproval changed to consternation.</p>

<p>Turning, he faced Eleazer.</p>

<p>"Say, Eleazer," he faltered, "s'pose we was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
make a deal on this thing. S'pose, for the time bein'
I was to take over your job an' you was to take over
mine. S'pose you did the arrestin'? This affair's a
big one an' oughter be given all the frills a city policeman
would give it. That's due the town. Now
you seem to know a sight more 'bout how to manage
it than I do."</p>

<p>"You put on the badge; you tell the thief to stick
'em up; you put the pistol 'twixt his shoulders, or
wherever you think 'twill do the most good; an' you
snap the handcuffs on him. I'll see you get full credit
for it. Meanwhile, if there's a fire or an undertakin'
job, I'll manage 'em somehow."</p>

<p>Eleazer shook his head.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't do, 'Lish, no way in the world,"
he objected. "We can't go swappin' offices voted
us by the town. Folks wouldn't like it. Was I, a
common citizen, to shoot the criminal, I'd likely be
hauled up for murder. I'm willin' to stand by you
to the extent of goin' along an' keepin' you company;
but you must be the one that bears the brunt
of the job."</p>

<p>"I could resign my office."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Right now. In fact, I've had a notion to do so,
off an' on, for some time. You see, I never did want
to be sheriff. The office was foisted on me. I'm
findin' it pretty wearin'."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Man alive! Bein' sheriff in Wilton can't be
wearin'."</p>

<p>"U&mdash;m. Wal, mebbe it don't 'pear to be to an
onlooker. Still, it's an almighty big responsibility
for all that," Elisha insisted. "Besides, 'twas
kinder understood when I took the office there'd be
no arrestin' nor shootin'. Jewel robberies warn't in
the contract."</p>

<p>"But man alive, you ain't been burdened with
jewel robberies. 'Tain't as if they come every day
in the week."</p>

<p>"They're wearin' when they do come," Elisha
persisted.</p>

<p>"Everything's wearin' when it comes&mdash;fires an'
all such things. Did they happen seven days in the
week, we'd all be wore to the bone. But they don't."</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o."</p>

<p>"Wal, then, what you wailin' about? I should
think you'd kinder welcome a break in the monotony
instead of groanin' over it. 'Twill give you
a chance to show folks what you can do. The feller
can't do more'n shoot you an' should you be shot at
the post of duty, why the town would give you a big
funeral an' I myself would lay you out in just the
style you'd hanker to be laid out in."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;I don't hanker to be laid out,"
whimpered Elisha in an aggrieved tone.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose you do. None of us does. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
you might display a measure of gratitude for the
offer."</p>

<p>"Oh, I appreciate your kindness," amended the
wretched sheriff, fearful of losing his solitary prop.
"I appreciate it very much indeed."</p>

<p>Eleazer appeared mollified.</p>

<p>"You ain't told me yet none of the details of this
business," he suddenly remarked. "If I'm goin' to
help you, I'd oughter be told everything about it.
Who is the criminal? An' where is he? An' how'd
you come to get track of him?"</p>

<p>Alas, the questions were the very ones Elisha had
hoped to escape answering.</p>

<p>He had no mind to lay his cards on the table.
Nevertheless, he knew of no way to evade his confederate's
curiosity. Eleazer was touchy. It would
not do to risk offending him a second time.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, cautiously, Elisha poured out his
story and was rewarded to see the other town official
gape at him, open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul," he reiterated. "Bless my soul!
Who would 'a' drempt it?" he burst out when he
could contain himself no longer. "Wal, I never did
like that feller Heath. I suspected from the first
there was somethin' wrong about him. Prob'ly he
has queer eyes. You can always spot a criminal by
his eye. Kinder shifty an' fishy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't notice he had fishy eyes," mildly rejoined
Elisha.</p>

<p>"You ain't seen as much of the world as I have,
'Lish," was the patronizing retort.</p>

<p>"I don't know why," bristled the sheriff. "You
ain't never been twenty miles beyond Wilton."</p>

<p>"Possibly I ain't. Possibly I ain't," grudgingly
confessed Eleazer. "Travelin' ain't all there is to
life, though. I'm observin', I am. I understand human
nature. This Heath feller, now. I understand
him."</p>

<p>"Then p'raps you can foretell what he's likely to
do when I arrest him," put in Elisha eagerly.</p>

<p>"I can," Eleazer nodded. "I can prophesy just
about what he'll do."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It's better I shouldn't tell you. 'Twouldn't be
wise. We must do our duty no matter what comes
of it."</p>

<p>Again Elisha's knees weakened beneath him.</p>

<p>"Seems to me," went on Eleazer, "that 'stead of
loiterin' here discussin' the calamities of the future
you'd better be gettin' on to your house. You've
got to put on your other clothes. The press, most
likely, will want to photograph you. Then you
must hunt up your badge, your handcuffs an' all
your paraphernalia. I'd better cut across the field,
meantime, an' oil up my pistol. Mebbe I can fix it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
so'st it'll go off. I'll try an' find you some cartridges,
too. I wouldn't want to stand by an' see you struck
down without your havin' some slight defense, poor
as 'tis."</p>

<p>With this dubious farewell, Eleazer bustled off
across the dingle and was lost to sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Left</span> alone, Elisha gloomily pursued his way to his
own cottage and entering it by the side door passed
through the back hall and upstairs.</p>

<p>From the shed he could hear May Ellen, his
housekeeper, singing lustily as she mopped the floor
to the refrain of <cite>Smile, Smile, Smile</cite>.</p>

<p>The sentiment jarred on him. He could not smile.</p>

<p>Going to the closet, he took out his Sunday suit,
shook it, and with the air of one making ready his
shroud, spread it upon the bed. It exhaled a pungent,
funereal mustiness, particularly disagreeable at the
moment.</p>

<p>Next he produced a boiled shirt, a collar, and a
black tie.</p>

<p>It took him some time to assemble these infrequently
used accessories, and he was dismayed to
find no collar-button.</p>

<p>Nervously he searched the drawers, tossing their
contents upside down in fruitless quest for this indispensable
article.</p>

<p>A collar-button was the corner-stone of his toilet&mdash;the
object on which everything else depended.
Should it fail to be forthcoming, the game was up.
He could not administer the law without it.</p>

<p>Perhaps, viewing the matter from every angle, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
disappearance was a fortunate, rather than an unfortunate,
omen.</p>

<p>Now that he had had time for sober reflection, the
enterprise on which he had embarked appeared a
foolhardy&mdash;almost mad undertaking. To grapple
with an experienced criminal was suicidal. It was
bad enough to do so if forced into the dilemma by
chance. But to seek out such an issue deliberately!
He wondered what he had been thinking of. Excitement
had swept him off his feet and put to rout
both his caution and his common sense.</p>

<p>He wished with all his heart he had never mentioned
the matter to Eleazer. But for that, he could
pull out of it and no one would be the wiser.</p>

<p>Suppose the criminal did escape? Were not lawbreakers
doing so every day?</p>

<p>One more at large could make little difference in
the general moral tone of society. Anyway, no
criminal&mdash;no matter what a rascal he might be,
was worth the sacrifice of a man's life&mdash;particularly
his life, argued Elisha.</p>

<p>But, alas, there was Eleazer to whom he had precipitately
confided the entire story!</p>

<p>No, there was no possibility of his backing out of
the affair now and washing his hands of it. He must
go through with it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he would postpone the moment for
action as long as he was able.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, instead of donning his official garb, he
went down stairs to hunt up his badge and handcuffs.
These he kept in the drawer of the tall secretary
in the sitting-room and although he had not
seen them for months, he felt certain they would
still be there.</p>

<p>In order to make no noise and arouse May Ellen's
phenomenal curiosity, he took off his shoes.</p>

<p>To his consternation, the drawer was empty!</p>

<p>And not only was it empty but it had been left
open as if a marauder possessed of sticky hands had
hastily abandoned it.</p>

<p>Elisha paused, confounded. Who could have taken
these symbols of the law? Who would wish to take
them? Certainly not May Ellen.</p>

<p>Even if her inquiring mind had prompted her to
ransack his property, she was far too honest a person
to make off with it. Furthermore, what use
could a peaceable woman have for a sheriff's badge
and a pair of handcuffs?</p>

<p>Unwilling to believe the articles were gone, Elisha
peered feverishly into every corner the piece of furniture
contained. He even hauled out the books
and ran his hand along the grimy shelves behind
them. But beyond a thick coating of dust, nothing
rewarded his search.</p>

<p>At length, as a last resort, he reluctantly shouted
for May Ellen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>She came, a drab woman&mdash;thin-haired, hollow-chested
with a wiry, hipless figure and protruding
teeth.</p>

<p>"Wal, sir?"</p>

<p>"May Ellen, who's been explorin' this secretary
of mine? Some of the things that oughter be in it,
ain't," blustered he.</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>The woman's eye was faded, but it held a quality
that warned the sheriff she was not, perhaps, as
spiritless as she looked.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh, just some little things I was huntin'
for," he amended, adopting a more conciliatory
tone.</p>

<p>"If I knew what they was, I could tell you better
where they might be lurkin'."</p>

<p>Alas, there was no help for it!</p>

<p>"I'm lookin' for my handcuffs an' sheriff's
badge," answered Elisha.</p>

<p>"There ain't been a crime? You ain't goin' to
arrest somebody?"</p>

<p>"I ain't at liberty to answer that question just
now," replied Elisha with importance.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us! You don't tell me a crime's been
committed in Wilton! I guess it's the first time in
all the town's history. Won't folks be agog? It'll
stir up the whole community."</p>

<p>The sentiment held for Elisha a vaguely familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ring. As he speculated why, he recalled with dismay
that it was he himself who, not a week ago,
had brazenly willed the very calamity that had now
befallen the village.</p>

<p>To be sure, he spoke in jest. Still it behooved a
man to be careful what he wished for. Providence
sometimes took folks at their word and answered
prayers&mdash;even idle ones.</p>

<p>"You mustn't peep about this outside, May
Ellen," he cautioned. "Was you to, no end of harm
might be done. The criminal, you see, is still at
large an' we want to trap him 'fore he suspects we're
after him."</p>

<p>"I see," replied the woman with an understanding
nod. "I won't breathe a breath of it to a soul.
But while we're mentionin' it, I would dearly like
to know who the wretch is."</p>

<p>"That's a secret of the law. I ain't free to publish
it. You shall be told it, though, soon's the arrest
is made. Now 'bout the badge an' handcuffs.
You see how important 'tis I should have 'em.
They was in the drawer an' they'd oughter be there
now. Instead, the whole place is messed up an'
sticky as if some person who had no business meddlin'
had overhauled it."</p>

<p>He saw May Ellen's faded eyes dilate with sudden
terror.</p>

<p>"It's that miserable Tommy Cahoon!" inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>rupted she. "His mother left him an' Willie here
with me a week ago when she went to Sawyer Falls
shoppin'. I saw 'em playin' policeman out in the
back yard, an' noticed one of 'em was wearin' a badge,
but I thought nothin' of it, supposin' they'd brought
it with 'em. The little monkeys must 'a' sneaked
indoors when I wasn't lookin' an' took that an' the
handcuffs. I'm dretful sorry. Still, boys will be
boys, I reckon," concluded she with a deprecatory
smile and a shrug of her angular shoulders.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;good Heavens&mdash;" sputtered Elisha.</p>

<p>"I'm sure we can find the missin' articles, unless
the children took 'em home&mdash;which I doubt," went
on the woman serenely. "Last I saw of the imps
they was out yonder under the apple trees. S'pose
we have a look there."</p>

<p>Almost beside himself with an indignation he
dared not voice, Elisha followed May Ellen out of
doors.</p>

<p>Yes, trampled into the sodden ground lay the
badge&mdash;its gleaming metal surface defaced by mud,
and its fastening broken. There, too, lay the handcuffs,
tightly snapped together and without a trace of
a key to unlock them.</p>

<p>Elisha, livid with rage, opened his lips prepared
to consign to the lower regions not only Tommy and
Willie Cahoon, but their mother and May Ellen as
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Before he could get the words out of his mouth,
however, the suave voice of his housekeeper fell gently
on his ear.</p>

<p>"'Course you can't lay this mishap up against me,
Elisha," she was saying. "I ain't no more responsible
for the children's thievin' than you are for the
crime of the criminal you're preparin' to arrest. The
actions of others are beyond our control. All we can
do is to live moral lives ourselves."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you do feel I'm to blame, you'll just have to
get somebody else to do your work. I wouldn't stay
in no situation an' be regarded as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ain't blamin' you a mite, May Ellen," Elisha
hurriedly broke in, panic-stricken lest his domestic
tranquillity trembling so delicately on the brink of
cataclysm topple into the void and be swallowed up.
"As you say, the doin's of others are somethin' we
can't take on our shoulders. Thank you for helpin'
me hunt up these things."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he dubiously eyed the muddy objects
in his hand. Well, at least, thought he, everything
was not lost. He had gained time.</p>

<p>To wear his badge until a new pin was soddered to
it was out of the question. In addition, the handcuffs
were of no use at all unless a key could be found
to unlock them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt like a doomed man who had been granted
an unlooked-for reprieve.</p>

<p>Eleazer would be nettled.</p>

<p>When he came steaming back with the revolver he
would storm and rage like a bluefish in a net.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, accidents were unavoidable and in
the meantime, while the emblems of the law were
being repaired, who could tell what might happen?</p>

<p>Stanley Heath might escape and take the jewels
with him&mdash;escape to some other part of the world
and pass on to a larger and more competent party of
criminal investigators the unenviable task of arresting
him.</p>

<p>Elisha was quite willing to forego the honor.</p>

<p>No longer did he desire to see his picture emblazoned
on the front pages of the papers or behold
his name in print. If he could shrink back into being
merely a humble, insignificant citizen of Cape
Cod, it was all he asked.</p>

<p>As he turned to reënter the house, Eleazer hailed
him.</p>

<p>"I've had the devil of a time with this revolver,"
announced he, puffing into the yard and jauntily
flourishing the weapon.</p>

<p>"Take care, Eleazer! Don't you go pointin' that
thing at me!" Elisha yelled.</p>

<p>"I ain't pointin' it at you. Even if I was, there'd
be no chance of it hurtin' you. 'Tain't loaded."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the kind that always goes off," the sheriff
insisted. "For Heaven's sake, wheel it the other
way, can't you? Or else aim it at the ground."</p>

<p>"Wal, since you're so 'fraid of it, I will. But for
all that, there ain't an atom of danger." Then regarding
his comrade's greenish countenance, he remarked
abruptly, "Say, what's the matter with you,
'Lish? You ain't got on your other suit, nor your
badge, nor nothin'. What in thunder have you been
doin' all this time? I've been gone 'most an hour."</p>

<p>Elisha told his story.</p>

<p>"Wal, if that ain't the ole Harry!" fumed Eleazer.
"That's goin' to ball us all up. There's no use doin'
this thing if it ain't done in bang-up style. We don't
want a lot of city cops jeerin' at us. We got to get
that badge soddered an' them handcuffs unlocked
'fore another move can be made. I s'pose mebbe
Nate Harlow over to Belleport could help us out."</p>

<p>"An' go blabbin' all over town the predicament
the Wilton sheriff was in? No&mdash;sir&mdash;ee! Not if I
know it. I wouldn't turn to a Belleport man for aid
was the criminal to rush from hidin' an' go free. The
only thing to do is to motor to Sawyer Falls an' hunt
up Pete McGrath, the blacksmith. He's a wizard
with tools. I never knew no job to stump him yet.
He'll know what to do. The notion of goin' over
there ain't such a bad one, neither, 'cause Artie Nickerson,
the station-master's, got a relation on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Chicago police force an' had oughter be able to give
us a few pointers 'bout how folks is arrested."</p>

<p>Accordingly the two men set forth on their errand.</p>

<p>As the shabby Ford rattled over the sandy
thoroughfare, Elisha's strained countenance began
gradually to relax.</p>

<p>"Nice day for a ride," remarked he glancing toward
the sea. "Fine weather's certainly on the way.
Air's mild as summer. 'Fore long we'll be havin'
days worth noticin'."</p>

<p>"So we will. April's 'bout over an' May'll be on
us 'fore we know it. Then June'll come&mdash;the month
of brides an' roses."</p>

<p>The allusion was an unfortunate one.</p>

<p>Elisha stiffened in his seat.</p>

<p>Amid the whirlwind happenings of the day, he had
forgotten that the man at his elbow was his rival.</p>

<p>"You plannin' to wed in June, Eleazer?" asked he
disagreeably.</p>

<p>"That's my present intention."</p>

<p>"It's mine, too," said Elisha.</p>

<p>"Humph! Expectin' to live at the Homestead?"</p>

<p>Elisha nodded.</p>

<p>"So'm I," grinned Eleazer.</p>

<p>"Hope you'll invite me over, now and then,"
Elisha drawled sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Hope you'll do the same," came from Eleazer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>For an interval they rode on in uncomfortable
silence.</p>

<p>"Them boats is pretty heavy loaded," Eleazer
presently volunteered, gazing off towards the horizon
where a string of dull red coal barges trailed along in
the wake of a blackened tug.</p>

<p>"Makin' for New York, I reckon," Elisha responded,
thawing a little.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't be s'prised if that Heath chap came
from New York," ruminated Eleazer.</p>

<p>"Confound Heath! I wish I'd never laid eyes on
him!" exploded Elisha.</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno as I'd go so fur as to say that," came
mildly from his companion. "Ain't Heath's comin'
goin' to put Wilton on the map? Bad's he is, we've
got him to thank for that. With him safely handed
over to the authorities, our fortune's made. What
you plannin' to do with your half of the reward?"</p>

<p>Here was a delightful topic for conversation!</p>

<p>Elisha's eyes brightened.</p>

<p>"I ain't decided yet," smiled he.</p>

<p>"Wonder how much 'twill be? Oughter come to
quite a sum, considerin' the risk one takes to get it."</p>

<p>Elisha's newly captured good-humor vanished.
Lapsing into moody silence, he did not speak again
until the white spire of the Sawyer Falls church
appeared and, rounding the bend of the road, the car
rolled into the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Compared to the villages of Wilton or Belleport,
this railroad terminus was quite a metropolis. It
boasted two dry-goods stores, an A &amp; P, a drug
store, a coal office, a hardware shop, and a grain shed.
Around its shabby station clustered a group of motor
cars, a truck or two, and the usual knot of loitering
men and boys.</p>

<p>In spite of his depression, Elisha's spirits took
another upward turn.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see something different,
something more bustling and novel than his home town.</p>

<p>"S'pose we drop in an' get a moxie," he suggested.</p>

<p>"'Twould go kinder good. I want to buy a roll of
lozengers, too, an' some cough drops now I'm here."</p>

<p>"Come ahead."</p>

<p>"Don't you s'pose we'd oughter go to the smithy
first an' leave the badge? It may take some little
time to get it mended," Eleazer said.</p>

<p>The badge!</p>

<p>Would the man never cease dangling before his
vision the wretched memories Elisha was struggling
so valiantly to forget?</p>

<p>With an ungracious, wordless grunt, he grudgingly
turned the nose of the car toward the railroad.</p>

<p>The small shed where the forge stood was close by
the tracks and as he pulled up before it, he espied
through its doorway not only Peter McGrath, the
blacksmith, but also the rotund figure of Artie Nick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>erson, the Sawyer Falls station agent.</p>

<p>"Art's inside! Ain't that luck?" he remarked,
clambering out of the car. "The station must be
closed an' he's come across the road to neighbor with
Pete."</p>

<p>They went in and after the usual greetings, Elisha
stated his errand.</p>

<p>McGrath took the handcuffs and badge to the light
and examined them.</p>

<p>"Humph! Looks as if you'd been in some sort of
a scrimmage," he commented.</p>

<p>"I ain't. Things get weared out in time. The
pin on that badge warn't never right. 'Twouldn't
clasp. As for the handcuffs, I reckon they're O.K.
'cept for the key bein' gone. Think you can make
me one?"</p>

<p>"Sure. That ain't no trick at all. I can hammer
you out a skeleton key which, though 'twon't take
no prize as to beauty, will do what you want it to. I
can sodder some sort of a pin an' catch on the badge,
too. S'pose you ain't in no 'special hurry for 'em.
There don't 'pear to be a cryin' need round here for
such articles," he concluded with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I would like 'em," Elisha
demurred. "You see I'm plannin' to take 'em back
with me. I don't often get over here an' you never
can tell these days when such things may be wanted."</p>

<p>"Just as you say. I'll start on 'em straight away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
I ain't busy on nothin' that can't be put aside."</p>

<p>Elisha strolled over to a box and sat down to wait.</p>

<p>"How are you, Art?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Tol'able. Havin' some rheumatism, though.
Reckon we've all got to expect aches an' pains at our
age."</p>

<p>"That's right. Speakin' of handcuffs an' badges,
didn't you have a nephew or a cousin 'sociated with
a police force somewheres?"</p>

<p>"Bennie, you mean? Oh, yes. He's a policeman
out in Chicago."</p>

<p>"How's he gettin' on?"</p>

<p>"Fine! Fine! Just now he's laid up in the hospital,
but he 'spects to be out again 'fore long. Got
shot through the arm a couple of weeks ago."</p>

<p>"You don't say? Huntin'?" Elisha queried
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Huntin'? Mercy, no! He got winged by a stray
bullet while chasin' up a guy that had broke into a
store. The shrimp hit him. Luckily he didn't kill
him. Ben thought he got off pretty easy."</p>

<p>Elisha's smile faded.</p>

<p>"These fellers that's at large now don't give a hang
who they murder," went on the station agent affably.
"They're a desperate crew. They'd as soon kill you
as not. Bennie landed his man, though, 'spite of
bein' hurt. 'Twill, most likely, mean a promotion
for him. He'd oughter be promoted, too, for he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
done great work on the force. Been shot three or
four times while on duty. 'Tain't a callin' I myself
would choose, but he seems to get a big kick out
of it."</p>

<p>Elisha, pale to the lips, suddenly decided he had
heard enough of Bennie and shifted the subject.</p>

<p>"S'pose you're still goin' round in the same ole
treadmill over at the station, Art," he observed.</p>

<p>"Yep. Same ole rut. Two trains a day as usual.
I've had, though, a bit more telegraphin' to do of late
than formerly. It's all come from your part of the
world, too. Know a feller over to Wilton named
Heath? He's sent off several wires."</p>

<p>Both Elisha, perched on the box, and Eleazer
astride a keg straightened up.</p>

<p>"Heath? Yes, indeed. He's stoppin' in town for
a while."</p>

<p>"So I gathered. Lives in New York at one of them
big hotels."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" Eleazer demanded.</p>

<p>"He sent a wire to his wife. Leastways, I figger
'twas his wife. He signed himself <cite>Lovingly, Stanley</cite>,
an' addressed it to Mrs. Stanley Heath."</p>

<p>"You don't say! That's news to me," Elisha
cried. He darted a glance at Eleazer.</p>

<p>Artie, gratified at seeing he had created a sensation,
beamed broadly.</p>

<p>"'Course I ain't permitted to divulge messages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that go through my hands. They're confidential.
But for that I could tell you somethin' that would
make your eyes pop outer their sockets."</p>

<p>"Somethin' about Heath?"</p>

<p>"Somethin' he said in a telegram."</p>

<p>"You might give us a hint," Eleazer suggested.</p>

<p>"I couldn't. Was I to, I might lose my job."</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain't askin' you to repeat no private wire."</p>

<p>"I couldn't even if you did."</p>

<p>Emphatically Artie shook his head.</p>

<p>Then Elisha had an inspiration.</p>

<p>"S'pose I was to ask you officially?" he suggested.
"S'pose it's important for me to know what was in
that message? S'pose I demanded you tell me in the
name of the law?"</p>

<p>"Shucks, 'Lish. You don't get round me that
way," the station agent laughed.</p>

<p>"I ain't attemptin' to get round you. I'm askin'
you seriously as sheriff of the town of Wilton."</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest? What do you want to know
for?" Artie asked.</p>

<p>"Never you mind. That's my business. I've a
right to the information."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's different. Still, I reckon it's as well
I shouldn't repeat what Heath said word for word.
'Twouldn't interest you, anyhow. The wire was just
sent to a friend. The part that astonished me was
its beginnin'. It ran somethin' like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"'<cite>Safe on Cape with my lady. Shall return with
her later.</cite>'"</p>

<p>Simultaneously Elisha shot up from the box on
which he was sitting and Eleazer sprang from the keg
of nails.</p>

<p>"What interested me," droned on Artie, "was who
this lady could be. Heath, apparently, is a married
man. What business has he taggin' after some Wilton
woman an' totin' her back to New York with him
when he goes?"</p>

<p>"He ain't got no business doin' it," Eleazer
shouted. "He's a blackguard&mdash;that's what he is!
But don't you worry, Artie. He ain't goin' to put no
such scurvy trick over on any Wilton woman. Me
an' 'Lish'll see to that. We're onto him an' his doin's,
we are. How much more tinkerin' have you got to do
on them trinkets, Pete? The sheriff an' me is in a
hurry to get home."</p>

<p>"You'll have to give me a good half hour more."</p>

<p>"The deuce we will!"</p>

<p>"Can't do it in less."</p>

<p>"That'll mean we won't fetch up at Wilton 'til
after dark," Eleazer fretted.</p>

<p>"Sorry. I'm workin' at top speed. I can't go no
faster. You've set me quite a chore."</p>

<p>"There's no use goin' up in the air an' rilin' Pete
all up, Eleazer," Elisha intervened. "We'll just
have to be patient an' put off what we was plannin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to do until tomorrow. I reckon mornin'll be a better
time, anyway. Certainly 'twill do just as well."</p>

<p>"Mebbe," Eleazer grumbled. "Still, I'm disappointed.
Wal, that bein' the case, s'pose you an' me
step over to the drug store while we're hangin' round
an' do them errands we mentioned."</p>

<p>Elisha agreed.</p>

<p>A faint flush had crept back into his cheeks and
his eyes had regained their light of hope.</p>

<p>Chance was on his side.</p>

<p>He had wrested from Fate another twelve hours of
life, and life was sweet.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIII" id="Chapter_XIII">Chapter XIII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dawn</span> was breaking over Wilton and the first shafts
of sunlight transforming its pearly sands into sparkling
splendor and its sea into spangled gold, when a
trim motor car, bearing a New York number plate,
slipped quietly into the village and drew up at the
town garage.</p>

<p>From it stepped a man, small and somewhat bent,
with rosy cheeks, kindly brown eyes, a countenance
schooled to stolidity rather than naturally so, and
hair touched with grey.</p>

<p>"May I leave my car here?" he inquired of the
lad who was sweeping out the building.</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"Fill her up for me, please. And you might clean
her a bit. Some of the roads were pretty soft."</p>

<p>"They always are at this season of the year, sir.
You are astir early. I thought I was, but I reckon
you've beaten me. Come far?"</p>

<p>"New York."</p>

<p>"Been riding all night?"</p>

<p>The stranger nodded.</p>

<p>"I like traveling at night," he volunteered. "Less
traffic. Can you tell me where a Mr. Heath is
staying?"</p>

<p>"Heath? The chap who ran aground on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Crocker Cove sand bar?"</p>

<p>"He came in a boat," replied the other cautiously.</p>

<p>"Then he's your party. He's over to The Widder's."</p>

<p>"The Widow's?"</p>

<p>"U&mdash;h&mdash;aah."</p>

<p>"Where's that?"</p>

<p>"New round here, ain't you? If you warn't, you
wouldn't be askin' that question. The Widder lives
out yonder at the Homestead."</p>

<p>"How does one get there?"</p>

<p>"Wal, there are several ways. When the tide's
low, folks walk. It's even possible to motor round
by the shore if you've a light car. The quickest way,
though, an' the only way to reach the house when the
tide's full, as 'tis now, is to row."</p>

<p>Although the keen eyes of his listener narrowed,
they expressed no surprise. Apparently he was accustomed
to obstacles, and the surmounting of them
was all in the day's work.</p>

<p>"Where'll I find a boat?"</p>

<p>"That I couldn't say. The Widder keeps hers
t'other side of the channel. Mebbe, though, if you
was to go down to the beach some fisherman would
give you a lift across. 'Most any of 'em would admire
to if you're a friend of Marcia Howe's."</p>

<p>The stranger bowed but offered no comment. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
curiosity stirred within him concerning the information
the lad vouchsafed, at least he gave no sign.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he replied briefly. "You'll see the
car is put in good shape?"</p>

<p>"The very best."</p>

<p>"Much obliged. Will this road take me to the
beach?"</p>

<p>"Straight as an arrow. Pity you have to tote that
suit-case."</p>

<p>"I'm used to carrying luggage. It never bothers
me. Good morning."</p>

<p>Without wasting additional words or time, the
stranger nodded and started off briskly in the direction
indicated. Nevertheless, swiftly as he moved,
his eyes missed none of the panorama stretched before
him.</p>

<p>The swelling expanse of sea, rising and falling to
the rhythm of its own whispered music, caught his
ear; he noted the circling gulls that dipped to the
crests of the incoming waves or drifted in snowy
serenity upon the tide; saw the opalescent flash of
the mica-studded sands. Twice he stopped to fill his
lungs with the fresh morning air, breathing deeply
as if such crystalline draughts were an infrequent
and appreciated luxury.</p>

<p>When he reached the beach he halted, glancing up
and down its solitary crescent and scanning eagerly
the silvered house beyond the channel. Discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>ing no one in sight, he dragged from the shore a yellow
dory, clambered into it, and catching up the oars
began to row toward the dwelling silhouetted against
the water and the glory of the morning sky.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime, both Marcia and Sylvia had
wakened early and were astir.</p>

<p>The kitchen fire was already snapping merrily in
the stove, however, and the table was spread before
the latter made her appearance.</p>

<p>She came in, sweater and beret in hand, and carrying
a thick envelope with its dashingly scrawled
address still wet.</p>

<p>"Why, Sylvia, how you startled me!" Marcia exclaimed.
"I did not hear you come down stairs.
Why are you up so early?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to town to catch the morning mail."</p>

<p>"The mail? But, my dear child, why such
haste?"</p>

<p>Sylvia colored.</p>

<p>"I have to get off this letter."</p>

<p>"Have to?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to Hortie. You see, if I didn't answer
promptly he might think the candy had gone astray,"
explained the girl stepping to the mirror and arranging
a curl that rippled distractingly above her forehead.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, you must thank him for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
candy," Marcia agreed. "Still, is it necessary to do
so in such a rush&mdash;to walk to the village this
morning?"</p>

<p>"I mean to row over."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you can't, dear. I discovered last
night the boat was gone. Eleazer Crocker must have
appropriated it when he was here yesterday."</p>

<p>"How horrid of him! What earthly right had he
to take it?"</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"Didn't he ask if he might?"</p>

<p>"No. To tell the truth, I went to find a book for
him and was gone so long he apparently became
either peeved or impatient at my delay and like a
silly small boy went home mad, taking the boat with
him&mdash;at least that's my version of the story."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he did it to punish you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Anyway, whether he took it as a joke
or as a reprisal, I shall give him a good lecture when I
see him. It is a serious thing to be left out here with
no way of getting to land. We might have needed
the dory sorely. In fact, here we are with this tremendously
important letter that must be posted immediately&mdash;willy-nilly."</p>

<p>With eyes brimming with laughter, Marcia shot a
mischievous glance at her companion.</p>

<p>"It isn't just to thank Hortie for the candy that
I'm writing," that young lady replied sedately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
"You see, he asked if he might come to Wilton for
his summer vacation. He has to know so he can
make his plans."</p>

<p>"But it is only the last of April, beloved."</p>

<p>"Men need to know such things well in advance.
They have to adjust their business," returned Sylvia
magnificently.</p>

<p>"I see," smiled Marcia. "Under such conditions,
I suppose the sooner the letter is sent the better."</p>

<p>She did not say precisely what conditions were in
her mind, but evidently the comment mollified Sylvia
who, after wriggling her mop of curls through the
neck of her blue sweater, tossed beret and letter into
a chair and began, in high spirits, to help with the
breakfast.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding she did so graciously, it was
quite obvious her eyes were on the clock and that she
was fidgeting to be off; so as soon as the coffee and
toast were ready, Marcia begged her not to delay.</p>

<p>The girl needed no urging.</p>

<p>"The sooner I start, the sooner I shall be back, I
suppose," she answered with feigned reluctance.
"Men are so unreasonable. It's a perfect nuisance
to trot to Wilton with this letter at this hour of the
morning, especially if I must go the long way round.
Still, there's no other way to get it there. Any
errands?"</p>

<p>"Not today, thanks. Just the mail."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll wait for it."</p>

<p>The eagerness betrayed by the reply left not the
slightest doubt that Sylvia would wait, and gladly.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her, Marcia smiled
whimsically.</p>

<p>She continued to smile, even to hum softly to herself
while she prepared Heath's breakfast tray, and
she was just about to take it upstairs when there was
a gentle knock at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>A stranger stood upon the threshold.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Stanley Heath staying here?" inquired he.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am Currier. Mr. Heath sent for me."</p>

<p>"Of course! Come in, won't you? Mr. Heath is
expecting you. I'll tell him you are here."</p>

<p>"You needn't do that, madam. Mr. Heath is
quite accustomed to my coming to his room at all
hours. If you will just show me where he is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At the head of the stairs."</p>

<p>"Very good. Thank you, madam. I will go up."</p>

<p>"Tell him I am bringing his breakfast very soon."</p>

<p>"I will, madam."</p>

<p>"Have you breakfasted yourself?"</p>

<p>"I? No, madam. But I beg you will not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll bring coffee and toast enough for both of
you."</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is no trouble."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will come back and fetch Mr. Heath's breakfast,
madam. Afterward, if I may have a snack here in
the kitchen, I shall be grateful."</p>

<p>"Any way that you prefer."</p>

<p>Marcia saw rather than heard the stranger mount
the staircase.</p>

<p>His step was like velvet. So noiseless was it, it
made not a sound either on the broad creaking staircase,
or on the floor overhead.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he must have entered Stanley
Heath's room, for soon she detected the invalid's
voice, imperative and eager, each sentence ending
with an interrogation. The lapses of silence which
intervened and which at first she took to be pauses,
she presently decided represented the inaudible and
subdued replies of Currier.</p>

<p>To judge from the sounds, Heath was pouring out
an avalanche of questions.</p>

<p>Sometimes he choked as if words came faster than
he could utter them; and once he broke into peals of
hearty laughter, followed by a paroxysm of coughing.</p>

<p>Still, Currier failed to return for the waiting tray.</p>

<p>"He has forgotten all about it," murmured Marcia.
"The coffee will be stone cold and the toast
ruined. I'll carry them up myself."</p>

<p>She mounted the stairs softly that her coming
might break in as little as possible upon the conversation
of her two guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"She was alone in the library when I went in,"
Heath was saying, "and turned so white I feared she
might faint or scream. Luckily she did neither.
Steadying herself against the table, she faced me.</p>

<p>"'You know what I'm after,' I said&mdash;'the jewels.'</p>

<p>"She hedged a moment.</p>

<p>"'What makes you think I have them?'</p>

<p>"'I know. Come, hand them over.'</p>

<p>"At that, she began to cry.</p>

<p>"'Quickly,' I repeated. 'Someone may come.'</p>

<p>"With that, she fumbled under her skirt and produced
the jewel-case, pouring out a torrent of explanations.</p>

<p>"I stopped no longer than I had to, I assure you.
With the jewels in my hand, I slipped through the
French window and made for the landing where I
had left the boat. In no time I had made my get-away.
Every detail of my plan would have gone
smoothly but for the fog. I lost my bearings completely.
Imagine my amazement at finding myself
here."</p>

<p>Marcia waited to hear no more.</p>

<p>Her knees trembled beneath her.</p>

<p>So Heath really had taken the jewels&mdash;taken
them from the resisting woman who owned them&mdash;taken
them against her will and made off with them!</p>

<p>He owned it!</p>

<p>Nay, more! Far from regretting what he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
done, in his tone rang a note of satisfaction in his
accomplishment.</p>

<p>She had never believed him guilty.</p>

<p>Even with the gems spread out before her and
every evidence of crime apparent, she had not believed
it.</p>

<p>Not until she heard the bitter, irrevocable confession
from his own lips did she waver, and even then
she battled against the truth, refusing to be convinced.
There must be some explanation, she told
herself. Nevertheless, the shock of what she had
learned was overwhelming.</p>

<p>It seemed as if every ounce of strength left her
body. Her head swam. Her heart beat wildly.</p>

<p>"I must not give way!" she reiterated to herself.
"I must put on a brave front. He must not suspect
I know."</p>

<p>It took a few moments for her to regain her grip
on herself, to quiet her throbbing heart, to drag back
her ebbing strength.</p>

<p>Then she knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Here is your coffee, Mr. Heath," she called.</p>

<p>She hoped his friend would open the door and relieve
her of the tray that she might immediately
withdraw, but instead, Heath himself responded:</p>

<p>"Come in, Mrs. Howe. I'm afraid we've delayed
you. I had entirely forgotten about breakfast and
so, I'll be bound, had Currier. You met my right-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>hand man down stairs, I take it. By traveling all
night, he made very good time."</p>

<p>"He must be tired after his trip!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Currier is used to traveling at all hours.
Night or day are both alike to him," laughed Heath.</p>

<p>"You found the house without trouble?" Marcia
inquired, making an effort to address the newcomer
in a natural, off-hand manner.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Howe. A young man at the garage
directed me to the beach and there I discovered a
yellow dory which I appropriated. I don't know as
I should have taken it, but as I needed a boat, I
pressed it into service."</p>

<p>"The boat happens to be mine."</p>

<p>"Indeed. Then perhaps you will pardon my using
it."</p>

<p>"Certainly. In fact, I am glad you did. It was
left on the mainland by mistake."</p>

<p>As Marcia turned to go, her unfailing courtesy
prompted her to add:</p>

<p>"Mr. Currier is welcome to stay if he wishes to,
Mr. Heath. We can put him up perfectly well."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He is returning directly. It seems wiser
for him to go back in the boat and leave the car for
me to use here. Nevertheless, I greatly appreciate
your kindness."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Heath is anxious," put in Currier. "She
begged me to come home as soon as possible that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
might know how Mr. Heath was. Naturally she has
been much worried."</p>

<p>"There, there, Currier&mdash;that will do," broke in
Stanley Heath, flushing. "And now, since Mrs.
Howe is here and is in our secret, I may as well break
to you something I have not yet had the chance to
tell you. Part of the mission on which you came
cannot be accomplished. You cannot take the gems
back with you to New York. A calamity has befallen
them."</p>

<p>"A calamity, sir?"</p>

<p>The small, grey-haired man looked from Stanley
Heath to Marcia, and for the first time, his imperturbable
countenance betrayed mingled amazement
and distress. Presently, however, he had it under
control and as if he had donned a mask, it became as
expressionless as the sphinx while he waited for the
rest of the story.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Howe helped me conceal the jewels downstairs
in a hiding-place under the kitchen floor," continued
Stanley Heath. "When she went to get them,
they were gone."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me so, sir!"</p>

<p>"It is all very mysterious," broke in Marcia, taking
up the tale. "I cannot in any way account for their
disappearance and am much distressed."</p>

<p>"Naturally so, madam&mdash;naturally so," responded
Currier politely. "And you have searched the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
carefully? Sometimes such things get misplaced."</p>

<p>"I've looked everywhere. They are not there."</p>

<p>"Have you any theory as to who could have taken
them?" inquired Currier with more animation than
he had up to the moment displayed.</p>

<p>"Absolutely none. I cannot even see how anybody
had the chance to take them. No one knew
they were there."</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to show me where they
were hidden and allow me to investigate?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I fear, however, search will be useless."</p>

<p>"Still I should like to look."</p>

<p>"I'll take you downstairs then, while we have the
opportunity. You must have something to eat, too,
for you must be hungry after your long ride."</p>

<p>"I could do with a cup of coffee, if convenient."</p>

<p>"You shall have more than that&mdash;a hearty breakfast.
I am sure you need it. When do you start
back?"</p>

<p>"That is for Mr. Heath to decide."</p>

<p>"Right off. As soon as you can get under way,"
Stanley Heath said decisively. "It is a fine day and
you had better make the most of the tide."</p>

<p>"That certainly would be wise, sir."</p>

<p>"Go down now with Mrs. Howe, since she is so
gracious, and have your breakfast. Examine, too,
the place where we concealed the jewel-case. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
may discover a clue she has missed."</p>

<p>"That is extremely unlikely, I fear, sir," was the
man's modest answer. "Still, I will look."</p>

<p>"I am sick at heart about all this," Marcia murmured
as the two descended the stairs. "You see, it
was I who suggested to Mr. Heath where to hide the
gems. We were hurried and had no time to think up
a place. I had used this hide-out before and as it had
always proved safe, I thought it would be so now. I
feel responsible&mdash;as if this loss was my fault."</p>

<p>"It is a great pity," was Currier's ambiguous reply.</p>

<p>Preceding him into the kitchen, Marcia went
straight to the hearth and pointed to the brick at
her feet.</p>

<p>"It was here we put the jewel-case," she said.</p>

<p>"I think, with your permission, I will take up the
brick," the little man at her elbow quietly announced.</p>

<p>"Certainly," acquiesced Marcia wearily.</p>

<p>"There might be some crevice, some opening&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I fear there isn't. Still you can try."</p>

<p>Taking out his knife, Currier knelt and soon had
the brick out of its hole.</p>

<p>Beneath it lay the jewel-case, wrapped as before
in Stanley Heath's monogrammed handkerchief.</p>

<p>Marcia could not believe her eyes.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;it wasn't there when I looked. I
could swear it wasn't."</p>

<p>"Who could have taken it out? And if someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
did why return anything so valuable?" Currier
inquired.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I do not understand it at all," the
woman replied, passing a hand across her forehead
in complete bewilderment. "There is something uncanny
about the whole affair."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, the gems are here now," said
Currier in a matter-of-fact tone. "Mr. Heath will
be much relieved. Their loss must, I am sure, have
distressed him deeply. Shall I go up and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll go," Marcia cried. "It won't take me a
minute. I'll be right back."</p>

<p>"As you prefer, madam."</p>

<p>Off flew Marcia.</p>

<p>Her haste, the radiance of her face must have suggested
to the stranger a thought that had not occurred
to him before, for after she had gone, he stood
immovable in the middle of the floor looking after
her.</p>

<p>Then a slow, shadowy smile passed across his
features.</p>

<p>Thrusting his hands into his pockets, he took two
or three meditative strides up and down the room.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;ho!" he muttered. "So&mdash;ho!"</p>

<p>It happened he had quite an opportunity for
thought before his hostess returned and he employed
it to the utmost.</p>

<p>He was still absorbed in reverie when Marcia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
breathless and flushed, rejoined him.</p>

<p>She made no apology for her absence.</p>

<p>Perhaps she did not realize the length of time she
had been gone.</p>

<p>"Well," queried she, "what conclusion have you
arrived at?"</p>

<p>"A very interesting one," Currier returned
promptly.</p>

<p>"Really? What is it?"</p>

<p>The man appeared taken aback.</p>

<p>"I misunderstood your question," he faltered. "I
had something else in mind."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you could have. I can think of
nothing but the jewels and their recovery. I am so
happy I had completely forgotten your breakfast.
Forgive me. You shall have it right away."</p>

<p>"If you would allow me, I can prepare it myself.
I am accustomed to doing such things."</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Scrambled eggs take only a few
moments; and bacon. You might run up to see Mr.
Heath while I am getting them ready."</p>

<p>"I will do that. I shall be leaving at once and he
may have final orders for me, or perhaps a letter for
Mrs. Heath."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Heath!" Marcia repeated, as if the name
suddenly brought before her consciousness something
hitherto forgotten. "Yes, yes! Of course!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Then turning her head aside, she inquired with
studied carelessness:</p>

<p>"How long, I wonder, does Mr. Heath plan to remain
in Wilton?"</p>

<p>"I could not say, madam."</p>

<p>"I think," hurried on the woman, "that as soon
as he is able to make the journey he would better go
home. This climate is&mdash;is&mdash;damp and he will,
perhaps, pick up faster away from the sea. If you
have any influence with him, won't you please
advise it?"</p>

<p>The man's small, grey eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"I have no influence with Mr. Heath," replied he.
"Mrs. Heath has, however. Shall I tell her?"</p>

<p>"I wish you would."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later <cite>My Unknown Lady</cite> weighed anchor
and on the breast of the high tide, rounded the Point
and disappeared out to sea, carrying with her Currier
and the jewels.</p>

<p>Marcia watched until the last snowy ripple foaming
in her wake had disappeared. When the infinitesimal,
bobbing craft was no longer visible, she sank
into a chair and brushed her hand across her eyes.</p>

<p>The lips which but a short time before had curled
into smiles were now set and determined.</p>

<p>"And that's the end of that foolishness!" she
muttered. "The end!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIV" id="Chapter_XIV">Chapter XIV</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of Elisha's indignation toward Stanley
Heath, and his resolve to go to the Homestead with
the break of dawn, it was noon before he and Eleazer
got under way.</p>

<p>In the first place, the two men disagreed as to the
proper method of arresting the alleged criminal.</p>

<p>"You can't take him on no warrant, 'Lish,"
Eleazer objected, "'cause you ain't actually got
proof he's guilty."</p>

<p>"Proof? Ain't I got a clear case? Ain't I roundin'
him up with the loot on him?" blustered Elisha.</p>

<p>"Mebbe. Still, it's my opinion you can't do more'n
take him on suspicion."</p>

<p>"Suspicion!" Elisha repeated scornfully. "Suspicion!
Would you call a fistful of diamonds suspicion?
I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"P'raps&mdash;p'raps you didn't really see the jewels,"
Eleazer quavered. "Sometimes folks get to imaginin'
things&mdash;seein' what ain't there. Are you
plumb certain you saw them things?"</p>

<p>"Certain?"</p>

<p>"Come, come! Don't go up in the air, 'Lish. I
ain't doubtin' your word. Nothin' of the sort. I just
want to make sure we don't take no missteps an'
make jackasses of ourselves," Eleazer explained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
"This is a big affair. We've got to move careful."</p>

<p>"Humph! You're shifty as the sands. You didn't
talk like this yesterday."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. But after sleepin' on the matter,
I've thought more 'bout it."</p>

<p>"Sleepin' on it! You were lucky if you could
sleep on it. I didn't. I never closed my eyes from
the time I went to bed 'till mornin'. Heard the clock
strike every hour. You can't 'cuse me of not thinkin'.
I'll bet I've done full as much thinkin' as you&mdash;mebbe
more. Had you the prospect of bein' shot
ahead of you, you'd think&mdash;think pretty hard, I
figger," Elisha growled.</p>

<p>"No doubt I would," conceded Eleazer mildly.
"Wal, 'long's we've both chewed the matter over, I
reckon there's nothin' more to be done now but go
ahead."</p>

<p>"Take Heath on suspicion, you mean? Humph!
Seems an awful cheap sort of way to do it, in my
opinion. Kinder meechin'. There ain't no dignity
to it."</p>

<p>"What's the use of standin' here bickerin' half the
mornin', 'Lish?" Eleazer said fretfully. "Let's get
started. Next we know Heath may get wind of what
we're up to an' light out."</p>

<p>"No danger of that with the Homestead dory on
this side of the channel," Elisha sniffed.</p>

<p>"For all that, no purpose is served by puttin' off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the evil hour. I say we get under way," Eleazer
urged. "Have you got everythin'?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;guess so," Elisha said weakly.</p>

<p>"Pete fixed up your badge in great shape, didn't
he?" was Eleazer's cheerful comment. "It's bright
as a new dollar. Anybody could see it a mile away."</p>

<p>Elisha offered no reply.</p>

<p>"An' the handcuffs, too&mdash;they look grand. Why
don't you kinder dangle 'em so'st they show? Why
stuff 'em in your pocket? Was I in your place, I'd
stalk into the Homestead with the handcuffs in one
hand an' the pistol in the other."</p>

<p>"You ain't in my place!" Elisha snapped. "I
wish to heaven you were."</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," his confederate returned promptly.
"I'm only playin' second fiddle on this job. The
whole responsibility's yours."</p>

<p>"Don't I know it? Why rub it in?"</p>

<p>"I ain't rubbin' it in. I'm just sorter cautionin'
myself. You see when I'm mixed up in a job, I get
so interested I'm liable to forget an' go ahead as if
the whole enterprise was my own."</p>

<p>"You're welcome to shoulder this one if you want
to. I give you permission," Elisha said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't think of doin' that, 'Lish. I
wouldn't want to steal the glory from you. You're
the big shot on this occasion," cajoled Eleazer.
"Wal, what do you say to our settin' out?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Elisha did not move.</p>

<p>"Don't it 'most seem as if we'd oughter eat somethin'
'fore we go? I might turn faint doin' arrestin'
on an empty stomach."</p>

<p>"But man alive, you et your breakfast, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"That was some little while ago," argued Elisha.
"I'm feelin' a wee mite gone a'ready. I'd oughter
have a lunch or somethin'."</p>

<p>"Wal, since you mention it, I could do with a
couple of doughnuts an' slab of cheese myself,"
Eleazer confessed.</p>

<p>This information delighted Elisha.</p>

<p>"We might put off goin' 'til after dinner," he suggested.
"Then we'd be primed by a good square
meal an' be braced for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can't wait that long," his comrade immediately
objected.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o, I s'pose we can't. Wal, anyhow, I'll go
hunt up a snack of somethin'."</p>

<p>"Don't bring nothin' but doughnuts an' cheese,"
Eleazer bellowed after him. "We can munch on
them while walkin' to the beach."</p>

<p>The stroll to Crocker's Cove was not a hilarious
one, even May Ellen's twisted crullers failing to
stimulate Elisha's rapidly ebbing strength. With
each successive step his spirits dropped lower and
lower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"You walk like as if you was chief mourner at
your own funeral, 'Lish," Eleazer fretted. "We'll
never make the Cove if you don't brace up."</p>

<p>"My shoes kinder pinch me."</p>

<p>"Walk on your toes."</p>

<p>"It's my toes that hurt."</p>

<p>"Walk on your heels then. Walk anywhere that's
most comfortable, only come along."</p>

<p>"I am comin'."</p>

<p>"At a snail's pace," Eleazer retorted. "Soon
folks will be comin' from the noon mail an' what
we're doin' will get noised abroad."</p>

<p>Reluctantly Elisha quickened his steps.</p>

<p>At last they came within sight of the bay.</p>

<p>"Where'd you leave the boat?" Eleazer questioned.</p>

<p>"I pulled her up opposite the fish-shanty."</p>

<p>"She ain't here."</p>

<p>"Ain't here!"</p>

<p>"No. Look for yourself."</p>

<p>"My soul an' body!"</p>

<p>"I told you you hadn't oughter dally. What's to
be done now?"</p>

<p>"I reckon we'll just have to give it all up," the
sheriff responded with a sickly grin. "Call it off."</p>

<p>"Call it off? But you can't call it off. Officers of
the law have got to do their duty no matter what."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes! Of course. I only meant we'd call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
it off for the present&mdash;for today, p'raps."</p>

<p>"An' let the thief escape? No sir&mdash;ee! We've
got to go through with this thing now we've started
if it takes a leg. We'll walk round by the shore."</p>

<p>"It's too far. My feet would never carry me that
distance."</p>

<p>"They've got to. Come along."</p>

<p>"I can't walk in all these clothes. This collar is
murderin' me."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, 'Lish. Quit whinin'."</p>

<p>"I ain't whinin'. Can't a man make a remark
without your snappin' him up, I'd like to know?
Who's sheriff anyhow&mdash;me or you?"</p>

<p>Eleazer vouchsafed no reply.</p>

<p>In high dudgeon the two men plodded through the
sand, its grit seeping into their shoes with every step.</p>

<p>It was not until they came within sight of the
Homestead that the silence between them was
broken.</p>

<p>"Wal, here we are!" Eleazer announced more
genially.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;here&mdash;here we are!" his comrade panted.
"S'pose we set down a minute an' ketch our breath.
My soul an' body&mdash;what a tramp! There's blisters
on both my heels. I can hardly rest 'em on the
ground."</p>

<p>"You do look sorter winded."</p>

<p>"I'm worse'n winded. I'm near dead! It's this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
infernal collar. It's most sawed the head off me,"
groaned Elisha.</p>

<p>"I don't see how it could. Every mite of starch
is out of it. It's limp as a pocket handkerchief."</p>

<p>"Mebbe. Still, for all that, it's sand-papered my
skin down to the raw. Collars are the devil's own
invention. Nobody oughter wear 'em. Nobody
oughter be made to wear 'em," raged Elisha. "Had
I known when I was made sheriff I'd got to wear
a collar, I'd never have took the job&mdash;never.
'Twarn't fair play not to tell me. In fact, there was
nothin' fair 'bout any of it. This arrestin', now! I
warn't justly warned 'bout that."</p>

<p>"Mebbe not," Eleazer agreed. "Still, I don't see's
there's anything to be done 'bout all that now.
You're sheriff an' your duty lies straight ahead of
you. You've got to do it. Come along."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Eleazer. Just hold on a second.
Let's take 'count of stock an' decide how we're goin'
to proceed. We've got to make a plan," pleaded
Elisha.</p>

<p>"But we've made a plan a'ready."</p>

<p>"No, we ain't&mdash;not a real plan. We've got to
decide 'xactly how we'll go 'bout the affair," contradicted
his companion. "After you've knocked at
the door an' gone in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I knocked an' gone in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Elisha repeated. "After that, you'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
sorter state the case to Marcia, 'xplainin' why we've
come an' everythin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' what'll you be doin' meantime?" Eleazer inquired,
wheeling sharply.</p>

<p>"Me? Why, I'll be waitin' outside, kinder loiterin'
'til it's time for me to go in&mdash;don't you see?"</p>

<p>"I don't. The time for you to go in is straight
after the door is opened. It's you that'll enter first
an' you who'll do the explainin'."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;s'pose Heath was to put up a
fight an' rush past me?"</p>

<p>"Then I'll be outside to stop him," Eleazer cut
in. "That's where I'm goin' to be&mdash;outside."</p>

<p>"You promised you'd stand by me," reproached
Elisha with an injured air.</p>

<p>"Wal, ain't I? If I stay outside ready to trip up
the criminal should he make a dash for freedom,
ain't that standin' by you? What more do you
want?"</p>

<p>"I think 'twould be better was you to go ahead
an' pave the way for me. That's how it's done in
plays. Some kinder unimportant person goes first
an' afterward the hero comes in."</p>

<p>"So you consider yourself the hero of this show,
do you?" commented Eleazer sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Ain't I?"</p>

<p>"Wal, you don't 'pear to me to be. Where'd you
'a' got that pistol but for me? Who egged you on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
an' marched you here&mdash;answer me that? You'd
'a' given up beat hadn't I took you by the scruff
of the neck an' hauled you here," Eleazer burst out
indignantly. "If you ain't the most ungrateful cuss
alive! I've a big half mind to go back home an' leave
you to do your arrestin' alone."</p>

<p>"There, there, Eleazer, don't misunderstand me,"
Elisha implored. "I was only jokin'. 'Course it's
you an' not me that's the hero of the day. Don't
I know it? That's why I was sayin' 'twas you should
go into the house first. In that way you'll get all
the attention an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' all the bullets!" supplemented Eleazer
grimly. "No&mdash;sir&mdash;ee! You don't pull the wool
over my eyes that way, 'Lish Winslow. You're goin'
to be the first one inside that door an' the last one
out. See? You're to do the arrestin'. If there's
undertakin' to be done afterwards, I 'tend to do it.
You get that clear in your head. Otherwise, I go
home."</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Eleazer, don't do that!" Elisha
begged. "Don't go home an' leave me&mdash;now&mdash;at
the last minute."</p>

<p>"You'll do the knockin' at the door? The announcin'
of our errand?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes. I swear I will."</p>

<p>"Very well," Eleazer agreed magnificently.
"Then I'll remain an' give you my moral support."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you'll do more'n that," urged Elisha
timidly.</p>

<p>"I may. I'll see how matters work out," Eleazer
returned pompously.</p>

<p>With lagging feet, the sheriff approached the door
of the big grey house.</p>

<p>"There's the dory," observed Eleazer, pointing
in the direction of the float. "Somebody's rowed it
over."</p>

<p>"I wonder who?"</p>

<p>"P'raps an accomplice has arrived to aid Heath.
What's the matter? You ain't sick, are you?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. I feel kinder&mdash;kinder queer."</p>

<p>"Indigestion! Them doughnuts most likely.
You et 'em in a hurry," was Eleazer's tranquil reply.
"Want a soda mint? I most generally carry
some in my pocket."</p>

<p>"No. I&mdash;I&mdash;I think it's my heart."</p>

<p>"Heart&mdash;nothin'. It's just plain indigestion&mdash;that's
what it is. I often have it. Don't think 'bout
it an' 'twill go away. Put your mind on somethin'
pleasanter&mdash;the arrestin' of Heath."</p>

<p>"That ain't pleasanter."</p>

<p>"Wal, think of somethin' that is then. Anything.
An' while you're thinkin', be walkin' towards the
house. You can think as well walkin' as settin' still,
I reckon."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wal, try it, anyhow."</p>

<p>Eleazer had a compelling personality. Under the
force of his will, Elisha found his own weaker one
yielding.</p>

<p>He got up and, dragging one foot after the other,
moved toward the house.</p>

<p>"Now knock," commanded the dictator.</p>

<p>Twice the sheriff reached forth his hand, wavered
and withdrew it.</p>

<p>"Why don't you knock, man?" Eleazer demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to."</p>

<p>Tremulously he tapped on the door.</p>

<p>No answer came.</p>

<p>"Knock, I tell you! That ain't knockin'. Give
the door a good smart thump so'st folks'll hear it an'
be made aware somethin' important's goin' on. I'll
show you."</p>

<p>Eleazer gave the door a spirited bang.</p>

<p>"Law, Eleazer! A rap like that would wake the
dead," Elisha protested.</p>

<p>"I want it should&mdash;or at any rate wake the
livin'," Eleazer frowned.</p>

<p>"I hear somebody. Stand by me, Eleazer. Where
are you goin'? Come back here, can't you? You
promised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't promise to go in first, remember. We
had that out an' settled it for good an' all. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
was to do that," Eleazer called from his vantage
ground round the corner.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" Elisha whimpered.</p>

<p>There was no more time for argument.</p>

<p>The door swung open and Marcia stood upon the
sill.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XV" id="Chapter_XV">Chapter XV</a></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Why</span>, Elisha!" exclaimed Marcia. "How you
startled me. Come in. You're all dressed up, aren't
you? Have you been to a funeral?"</p>

<p>"No. I&mdash;we&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sheriff cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Me an' Eleazer&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Eleazer? Did he come with you?"</p>

<p>Elisha nodded.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Outside."</p>

<p>"Isn't he coming in?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. He's comin' presently."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he doesn't dare," Marcia remarked with
spirit. "I don't wonder he hesitates. He ran off
with my dory yesterday."</p>

<p>"That warn't Eleazer. That was me."</p>

<p>"You? But I didn't know you were here."</p>

<p>"I was. I took the boat on official business,"
Elisha explained.</p>

<p>Marcia's laughter, crystalline as a mountain
stream, musical as its melody, rippled through the
room.</p>

<p>"Official business!" she repeated derisively.
"Official business indeed! When, I'd like to know,
did Wilton ever have any official business? Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
joke, Elisha. This taking my boat is no joking matter.
It is a serious thing to leave me here with no
way of getting ashore quickly. I didn't like it at
all."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," apologized the sheriff uncomfortably.
"You see, an emergency arose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No emergency is important enough for you to
take my boat without asking. Please remember
that."</p>

<p>"I will," squeaked the offender, coloring under the
reprimand like a chastened schoolboy. "I won't
do it again, I promise you."</p>

<p>"All right. You're forgiven this time. Now sit
down and tell me the news."</p>

<p>His dignity, his pomposity put to rout Elisha,
feeling very small indeed, backed into the nearest
chair.</p>

<p>Instead of making the rafters of the Homestead
quake at his presence; instead of humbling Heath,
reducing Marcia to trembling admiration, here he
sat cowed and apologetic.</p>

<p>It was not at all the sort of entrance he had
mapped out. It would not do. He had got a wrong
start.</p>

<p>Before Eleazer put in an appearance, he must
right himself.</p>

<p>With a preliminary ahem, he hitched forward in
the rocking chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"You won't mind if I go on with my baking, will
you?" Marcia said, bustling toward the stove. "I'm
makin' dried apple turnovers. They'll be done in
a second and you shall have one."</p>

<p>"I thought I smelled pie crust," Elisha murmured
vaguely.</p>

<p>"You thought right."</p>

<p>Kneeling, Marcia opened the door of the oven.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a sight for sore eyes?" inquired she
as she drew out a pan of spicy brown pastries and
placed them, hot and fragrant, on the table. "Now,
I'll get you a plate, fork and some cheese."</p>

<p>"I don't need no fork," Elisha protested. "I can
take it in my fingers."</p>

<p>"Oh, you better not do that. It's sticky and you
might get a spot on your Sunday clothes."</p>

<p>His Sunday clothes!</p>

<p>Elisha came to himself.</p>

<p>He rose up.</p>

<p>"I oughtn't to be eatin', anyhow," he called after
Marcia as she retreated into the pantry. "You see,
I come here this mornin' to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guess a nice hot apple turnover won't go amiss
no matter what you came for," interrupted the
woman, returning with the plate, fork and cheese.</p>

<p>With deftness she whisked the triangle of flaky
pastry onto the plate and extended it toward her
guest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Its warm, insidious perfume was too much for
Elisha.</p>

<p>He sat down with the plate in his lap.</p>

<p>He had taken only an introductory mouthful, however,
when the door parted a crack and Eleazer
crept cautiously through the opening.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood transfixed, viewing the
scene with amazement; then he burst out in a torrent
of reproach.</p>

<p>"'Lish Winslow, what on earth are you doin'?
Here I've been waitin' outside in the wind, ketchin'
my death of cold an' worryin' lest you was dead&mdash;hearin'
neither word nor sign of you&mdash;an' you settin'
here by the stove rockin' an' eatin' pie! What
do you think you come for, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I know, Eleazer, I know," Elisha stammered,
ducking his head before the accusing finger of his
colleague. "It may, mebbe, seem queer to you. I
just hadn't got round to the business in hand, that's
all. I'm comin' to it."</p>

<p>"Comin' to it? You don't look as if you was."</p>

<p>"I am," protested the sheriff, cramming the turnover
into his mouth and drawing his hand hurriedly
across his lips. "I'm comin' to it in time. Be
patient, Eleazer! Be patient, can't you?"</p>

<p>"I've been patient half an hour a'ready an' you
ain't, apparently, even made a beginnin'."</p>

<p>"Yes I have, Eleazer. I've made a start. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
pie's et. That's done an' over."</p>

<p>"But you had no right to stop an' eat. You had
no business eatin' pie, anyhow. Ain't you got indigestion?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;wal, yes. I do recall havin' a qualm or two
of dyspepsia," Elisha owned in a conciliatory tone.
"That's gone, though. I reckon the fresh air kinder
scat it off. I'd clean forgot about it."</p>

<p>"Mebbe you'd clean forgot what you come here
to do, too," derided Eleazer.</p>

<p>"No. Oh, no. I didn't forget that. I was just
leadin' up to it in a sorter tactful way."</p>

<p>"There ain't no way of bein' tactful when you're
arrestin' folks. You've got the thing to do an' you
have to go straight to it."</p>

<p>A fork clattered from Marcia's shaking hand to
the floor.</p>

<p>"Arresting folks?" she repeated, looking from
one man to the other.</p>

<p>"Yes. Since 'Lish is so spineless at his job, I
may's well tell you what we come for. He don't
'pear to have no notion of doin' so," Eleazer sneered.
"Pretty kind of a sheriff he is! You'd think to see
him he was at an afternoon tea."</p>

<p>"You better look out, Eleazer Crocker, how you
insult an officer of the law," Elisha bawled angrily.
"Say a word more an' I'll hail you into court."</p>

<p>"If you don't land me there faster'n you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Heath I shan't worry," jeered Eleazer.</p>

<p>"Heath? Mr. Heath?" Marcia repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes. We come over here this mornin' to place
Mr. Stanley Heath under arrest," Eleazer announced.</p>

<p>The woman caught at the edge of the table.</p>

<p>"Place him under arrest? What for?"</p>

<p>So they knew the truth! In some way they had
found it out and the net of the law was closing in.</p>

<p>Her mind worked rapidly. She must gain time&mdash;worm
out of them how much they know.</p>

<p>"Of what are you accusing Mr. Heath?" she demanded,
drawing herself to her full height and unconsciously
moving until her back was against the
door leading to the stairway.</p>

<p>"Of the Long Island robbery," Eleazer answered.</p>

<p>"You mean to say you think him a thief?"</p>

<p>"We know he's one&mdash;leastways Elisha does."</p>

<p>"Don't go foistin' it all on me," snarled Elisha.</p>

<p>"But you do know, don't you? You said you did."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;yes! I'm tol'able sure. I have evidence,"
Elisha replied. "At least I figger I have."</p>

<p>"Shucks, 'Lish!" Eleazer cried. "Where's your
backbone? You figger you have! Don't you know
it? Ain't you beheld the loot with your own eyes?"</p>

<p>Elisha nodded.</p>

<p>"Then why on earth don't you stand up in your
boots an' say so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened and Sylvia entered then stopped,
arrested on the threshold by the sound of angry
voices.</p>

<p>Inquiringly she looked from Marcia to the men,
and back again.</p>

<p>No one, however, heeded her presence.</p>

<p>Marcia, with whitened lips but with face grave
and determined, remained with her back to the
stairway door, her arms stretched across its broad
panels, her eyes never leaving Elisha Winslow's.
There was something in her face Sylvia had never
seen there&mdash;a light of battle; a fierceness as of a
mother fighting for her child; a puzzling quality to
which no name could be given.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the girl studied her, recognition of
this new characteristic flashed upon her understanding.</p>

<p>It was love!</p>

<p>Anger, perhaps terror, had forced Marcia into
betraying a secret no other power could have
dragged from her.</p>

<p>Sylvia marveled that the men whose gaze was
riveted upon her did not also read her involuntary
confession.</p>

<p>Apparently they failed to do so.</p>

<p>"Ain't I said a'ready I had proof? What more
do you want me to do, Eleazer?" Elisha fumed.</p>

<p>"What proof have you?" Marcia interposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Elisha shifted from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>"I've seen the jewels," he whispered. "They're
here&mdash;in this room. Don't think I'm blamin' you,
Marcia. 'Course Heath bein' what he is, is nothin'
against you," he hurried on breathlessly. "We're
all aware you wouldn't shelter no criminal did you
know he was a criminal; nor would you furnish a
hidin' place for his stolen goods. What I'm sayin'
is news to you an' a shock. I can see that. Naturally
it's hard to find our friends ain't what we
thought 'em. When faced with the evidence,
though, you'll see the truth same's Eleazer an' me
see it.</p>

<p>"Heath, the feller overhead, is the Long Island
jewel robber.</p>

<p>"The jewels he stole are under that brick. I've
seen 'em."</p>

<p>With finger pointing dramatically toward the
hearth, Elisha strode forward.</p>

<p>Sylvia, however, sprang before him, standing
'twixt him and his goal.</p>

<p>"What a ridiculous story, Mr. Winslow!" she
cried. "What a fantastic yarn! Do you imagine
for one moment there could be anything hidden
under those bricks and Marcia and I not know it?
Why, one or the other of us has been in this room
every instant since Mr. Heath arrived. When could
he get the chance to hide anything? Didn't you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Doctor Stetson get here almost as soon as he did?
Wasn't it you who undressed him? Had he brought
jewels with him you would have found them inside
his clothing. You took off every rag he wore. Did
you discover any such thing?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o."</p>

<p>"Well, then, don't you see how absurd such an
accusation is? How could the gems get here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how they got here. All I know
is they're here," Elisha repeated stubbornly.</p>

<p>Sylvia's brain was busy.</p>

<p>That Elisha by some means or other had stumbled
upon the truth there could be no doubt.</p>

<p>How was she to prevent it if he insisted upon
searching as it was obvious he intended to do?</p>

<p>Not only was Marcia ignorant of Heath's true
character but also that the jewels lay concealed close
at hand. She would receive an overwhelming shock
if the proof of his guilt came upon her in this brutal
fashion.</p>

<p>Did she not believe in him? Love him?</p>

<p>It was for Marcia Sylvia was fighting, not Heath&mdash;Marcia
whom she adored and whom she was determined
to save from Elisha's power at any cost.</p>

<p>If after the two meddling officials had gone she
could be convinced that the hero on whom her
heart was set was unworthy, that was matter for
later discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>All that was of import now was to defend him;
shield him from discovery; give him the chance for
escape.</p>

<p>It was at the moment she reached this decision
that Marcia's voice, calm and unwavering, broke
upon the stillness:</p>

<p>"If you are so certain about the jewels, Elisha,
why don't you produce them?" she was saying.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, Marcia!" Sylvia protested. "There
is nothing here, Mr. Winslow, truly there is nothing.
I swear it."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, let him look, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"But Marcia&mdash;" begged the girl.</p>

<p>"Step aside, dear, and let him look. Let them
both look."</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;please, Marcia&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Sylvia was upon her knees now on the hearth,
and the men, hesitating to remove her by force,
halted awkwardly.</p>

<p>Her face, drawn with terror, was upturned to
Marcia and was pitiful in its pleading.</p>

<p>Marcia regarded her first with startled incredulity&mdash;then
with coldness.</p>

<p>So Sylvia loved Heath, too!</p>

<p>She was fighting for him&mdash;fighting with all her
feeble strength.</p>

<p>A pang wrenched the older woman's heart.</p>

<p>What if Heath had played a double game&mdash;made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
love to Sylvia as he had made love to her? Convinced
her of the depths of his affection with an
ardor so compelling that against all odds she, too,
believed in it?</p>

<p>If so&mdash;if the man were a mountebank the sooner
they both found it out&mdash;the sooner all the world
knew it, the better.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, he was innocent, he should
have his chance.</p>

<p>The older woman went to the side of the pleading
figure.</p>

<p>The surprise of her discovery crisped her voice so
that it was short and commanding.</p>

<p>"Get up, Sylvia," she said. "The sheriff must
search. He must do his duty. We have no right to
prevent it."</p>

<p>Obedient to the authoritative tone, the girl arose.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, you may search," Marcia said.</p>

<p>Neither Elisha Winslow nor his companion had
cause now to complain of any lack of dignity in the
law's fulfillment.</p>

<p>As if she were a magistrate seeing justice done,
Marcia, magnificent in silence, towered above them
while they stooped to perform their task. Her face
was pale, her lips tightly set.</p>

<p>The brick was lifted out.</p>

<p>A smothered cry escaped Sylvia and was echoed
by Elisha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;land alive&mdash;there's nothin' here!"
gasped the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I told you there was nothing!" Sylvia taunted,
beginning to laugh hysterically. "I told you so&mdash;but
you would not believe me."</p>

<p>Tears were rolling down her cheeks and she wiped
them away, strangling a convulsive sob.</p>

<p>"Wal, 'Lish, all I can say is you must either 'a'
been wool gatherin' or dreamin' when you conceived
this yarn," Eleazer jeered.</p>

<p>"I warn't," hissed Elisha, stung to the quick. "I
warn't dreamin'. Them jewels was there. I saw
'em with my own eyes. I swear to heaven I did."
Then as if a new idea flashed into his mind, he confronted
Sylvia. "They was there, young lady,
warn't they? You know they was. That's why
you was so scairt for me to look. You've seen 'em,
too."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you. Deny it if you dare."</p>

<p>"Of course I deny it."</p>

<p>"Humph! But Marcia won't. You can lie if
you want to to save the skin of that good-for-nothin'
critter upstairs&mdash;though what purpose is served by
your doin' it I can't see. But Marcia won't. She'll
speak the truth same's she always has an' always
will. No lie will cross her lips. If she says them
jewels warn't here I'll believe it. Come now, Marcia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Mebbe you've evidence that'll hist me out of the
idiot class. Was there ever diamonds an' things
under this brick or warn't there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You saw 'em?"</p>

<p>As if the admission was dragged from her, Marcia
formed, but did not utter, the word:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"They was under this brick, warn't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There! Then I ain't gone daffy! What I said
was true," Elisha acclaimed, rising in triumph and
snapping his finger at Eleazer.</p>

<p>"The jewels were Mr. Heath's. He hid them for
safe keeping."</p>

<p>"He told you that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A likely story! He stole 'em&mdash;that's what he
did."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"I do," leered the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Prove it then," challenged Marcia, with sudden
spirit, a spot of crimson burning on either cheek.</p>

<p>"Prove it?" Elisha was taken aback. "Wal, I
can't at the moment do that. I can't prove it. But
even if I can't, I can make out a good enough case
against him to arrest him on suspicion. That's
what I mean to do&mdash;that's what I come for an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
what I'll do 'fore I leave this house."</p>

<p>Marcia swept across the floor.</p>

<p>Once again she was poised, back against the door
leading to the stairs.</p>

<p>"Mr. Heath is sick."</p>

<p>"I guess he ain't so sick but what I can go up an'
cross-examine him."</p>

<p>"I ask you not go to. I forbid it."</p>

<p>"Law, Marcia!"</p>

<p>"I forbid it," repeated the woman. "Drop this
matter for a day or two, Elisha. Mr. Heath shall
not leave the house. I promise you that. I will give
you my bond. Leave him here in peace until he is
well again. When he is able to&mdash;to&mdash;go with you
I will telephone. You can trust me. When have I
ever been false to my word?"</p>

<p>"Never, Marcia! Never in all the years I've
known you."</p>

<p>"Then go and leave the affair in my hands."</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;mebbe&mdash;I wonder if I'd
oughter," ruminated Elisha. "'Tain't legal."</p>

<p>"No matter."</p>

<p>"I don't see why the mischief you're so crazy to
stand 'twixt this Heath chap an' justice, Marcia.
The feller's a scoundrel. That's what he is&mdash;an out
an' out scoundrel. Not only is he a thief but he's
a married man who's plottin' behind your back to
betray you&mdash;boastin' openly in telegrams he is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like to tell you. In fact I couldn't.
'Twould be repeatin' what was told me in confidence,"
hedged Elisha, frightened by the expression
of the woman's face.</p>

<p>"You must tell me."</p>

<p>"Mebbe&mdash;mebbe&mdash;there warn't no truth in
what I heard."</p>

<p>"I must judge of that."</p>

<p>"I ain't got no right to tell you. Things are
often told me in confidence, 'cause of my bein'
sheriff, that it ain't expected I'll pass on."</p>

<p>"I have a right to know about the telegram you
mention. Will you tell me or shall I call up the
Sawyer Falls operator?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake don't do that," Elisha
pleaded. "Artie Nickerson would be ragin' mad did
he find I'd told you. If you must know what the
message was, I can repeat it near 'nough, I reckon.
It ran somethin' like this:</p>

<p>"<cite>Safe on Cape with my lady. Shall return with
her later.</cite>"</p>

<p>"And that was all?" inquired Marcia calmly.</p>

<p>"All! Ain't that enough?" Elisha demanded.
"There was a word or two more 'bout clothes bein'
sent here, but nothin' of any note. The first of the
message was the important part," concluded the
sheriff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>As she vouchsafed no reply and the ticking of the
clock beat out an embarrassing silence, he presently
continued:</p>

<p>"I don't want you should think I told you this,
Marcia, with any unfriendly motive. It's only that
those of us who've seen you marry one worthless
villain don't want you should marry another. Jason
was a low down cuss. You know that well's I."</p>

<p>The woman raised her hand to check him.</p>

<p>"I'm aware 'tain't pleasant to hear me say so
out loud, but it's God's truth. Every man an'
woman in Wilton knows 'tis. Folks is fond of you,
Marcia. We don't want you made miserable a second
time."</p>

<p>"Marcia!" Sylvia burst out. "Marcia!"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear. We'll talk of this later. Elisha,
I think I must ask you and Eleazer to go now. I
will let you know when Mr. Heath is able to take
up this affair with you."</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' to tell me where the jewels are?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where they are."</p>

<p>"Nor nothin' 'bout&mdash;'bout the telegram."</p>

<p>"Nothing except to thank you for your kind intentions
and say you quoted it quite correctly. I
sent it for Mr. Heath myself."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<cite>My Lady</cite>, as you have apparently forgotten, is
the name of Mr. Heath's boat&mdash;the boat you your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>self helped pull off the shoals."</p>

<p>"My land! So 'tis," faltered Elisha. "I'm almighty
sorry, Marcia&mdash;I ask your pardon."</p>

<p>"Me, too! We come with the best of intentions&mdash;"
rejoined Eleazer, fumbling for his cap.
"Honest we did."</p>

<p>"It's all right. Just leave us now, please."</p>

<p>As the two men shuffled across the kitchen, a
heavy object dropped to the floor, interrupting their
jumbled apologies.</p>

<p>"Pick up them handcuffs, 'Lish, an' come along
double-quick," Eleazer muttered beneath his breath.
"You've made a big enough fool of yourself as 'tis.
Don't put your foot in any deeper."</p>

<p>"And here's your hat," added Sylvia, handing
the bewildered sheriff his property with an impish
bow. "Take it and scram&mdash;both of you."</p>

<p>As the door banged behind the discomfited officials,
clear as a bell on the quiet air came the twitting
voice of Eleazer:</p>

<p>"Wal, Scram got said, didn't it, 'Lish, even if
'twarn't you said it? That gal is an up-to-date
little piece. She knows what's what. I told you
no shindy of this sort was complete unless somebody
said: Scram!"</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XVI" id="Chapter_XVI">Chapter XVI</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Left</span> alone, Marcia, weary and spent, collapsed into
a chair and closed her eyes, appearing to forget the
presence of the girl who, with parted lips, hovered
impatiently at her elbow.</p>

<p>Something in the woman's aloofness not only discouraged
speech but rendered any interruption an
intrusion.</p>

<p>At length, however, she roused herself and sighing
deeply looked about, and taking the gesture as permission
to break the silence, the torrent of words
Sylvia had until now held in check, broke from her:</p>

<p>"Was it true, Marcia&mdash;what they said about
Uncle Jason I mean? Was it true?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so, dear."</p>

<p>"But you never told me; and you never told
Mother, either. Of course I see why. You didn't
want her to know because it would have broken her
heart. So you kept it all to yourself. You did not
mean I should find it out, did you?"</p>

<p>"Not if I could help it."</p>

<p>Sylvia knelt, taking the cold hands in hers.</p>

<p>"I hate him!" cried she fiercely. "I hate him
for making you unhappy and spoiling your life!"</p>

<p>"Hush, child. Jason has not spoiled my life,"
contradicted Marcia with a grave, sad smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he has scarred it&mdash;dashed to pieces all the
dreams you started out with&mdash;those beautiful
dreams a girl has when she is young. I know what
they are, for I dream them myself sometimes. They
are lovely, delicate things. We never quite expect
they will come true; yet for all that we believe in
them. I know you had such fancies once, for you
are the sort who would. And Jason came and
trampled on them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He made me see life as it was. Perhaps it was
better I should."</p>

<p>"We all have to see life as it is sooner or later.
But there are plenty of years ahead in which to do it.
The man who destroys the world of illusion in which
a girl lives destroys something no one can ever give
back to her."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I should say that," returned
Marcia with a faint, shadowy smile as if pursuing
some secret, intriguing fancy.</p>

<p>"But it's never the same again, I mean&mdash;never
the same."</p>

<p>"No, it's never the same," agreed the woman
soberly.</p>

<p>"Was Jason as bad as they said, Marcia? Ah,
you don't have to answer. There is no need for you
to try to reconcile your desire to spare me&mdash;spare
him&mdash;with the truth. He was as bad&mdash;probably
much worse. Dear, dear Marcia." Impulsively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Sylvia bent her lips to the hands so tightly clasped
in hers. "I cannot imagine," she rushed on, "why,
when one of my family had made you as wretched
as he did, you should have wanted another in the
house. Had I suffered so I should never have wished
to lay eyes on any more Howes as long as I lived."</p>

<p>"But Jason had nothing to do with you, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"The same blood ran in our veins."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that was the reason."</p>

<p>"Because you could forgive, you mean?" whispered
Sylvia. "You are a better Christian than I,
my dear. I could never have forgiven."</p>

<p>"I have tried not only to forgive but to forget. I
have closed the door on the past and begun a new
life."</p>

<p>"And now into it has come this Stanley Heath,"
the girl said.</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second Marcia did not reply;
then almost inaudibly she murmured:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Sylvia slipped one of her strong young arms about
the bowed shoulders.</p>

<p>"It just seems as if I could not bear it," she
burst out passionately.</p>

<p>"Sylvia, look at me. Tell me the truth. Do
you, too, love Stanley Heath?"</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Was that the reason you fought against Elisha's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
finding the jewels? Tell me. I must know."</p>

<p>"No," she answered without hesitation. "At
first he did fascinate me. He is a fascinating person.
An older man always fascinates a younger girl if he
has charm. I changed my mind, though, later on.
Not because on acquaintance he became less charming.
It wasn't that. If anything, he became more
so. I just&mdash;just&mdash;changed my mind," she repeated,
avoiding Marcia's eyes. "As for the jewels,
I could not bear to let that little runt of a sheriff win
out. You see, I thought the gems were there under
the brick and that when you urged him to search,
you did not know it.</p>

<p>"I had known all along they were in the house,
for I stumbled upon them by accident one day when
I was here alone; but I had no idea you had. I
truly believed Mr. Heath had hidden them beneath
the hearth, and I was determined Elisha should not
find them."</p>

<p>"I knew they weren't there."</p>

<p>"You'd moved them? Put them somewhere
else?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Didn't you hear me tell Elisha I did
not know where they were?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course. But you'd have said that anyway,"
smiled Sylvia, dimpling.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, Sylvia!"</p>

<p>"You certainly wouldn't have let those men find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
them," she added comfortably.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, if the jewels had been in the
house and I had been compelled to tell what I knew,
I should have told the truth."</p>

<p>"You would? You would have showed those two
miserable blood-hounds where they were?" asked
the girl incredulously.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," flashed Sylvia, clinching her small
hands. "I would have fought that sheriff tooth
and nail. I'd have lied&mdash;stooped to any means to
prevent him from unearthing the evidence he was
after."</p>

<p>"But the law, Sylvia&mdash;the law."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give a rap for the law. You love
Stanley Heath. That's enough for me. Besides,
he is being tracked down&mdash;trapped. I want him
to go free."</p>

<p>"You think he took the jewels?" asked Marcia,
slowly.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But, Marcia, can't you see how plain it all is?
I know it is terrible for you, dear. It almost breaks
my heart. It is an awful thing to believe of anybody&mdash;harder
still of a person one loves. Nevertheless,
we must face the facts. People do not carry
such things about with them&mdash;especially men. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
came by them in no honest way, you may be sure
of that. Hasn't he told you anything?&mdash;haven't
you asked him?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't think of asking him," Marcia replied
with a lift of her chin.</p>

<p>"And he has not volunteered any information?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Most men, if honest and caught in such an odd
situation, would explain," continued Sylvia. "The
very fact that Mr. Heath has not is suspicious in
itself. He is guilty, Marcia&mdash;guilty."</p>

<p>"I do not believe it," was the stubborn protest.</p>

<p>"I realize, dear, it is hard for you to own it,"
soothed Sylvia. "We hate to admit the faults of
those we&mdash;we&mdash;care for. Still, nothing is to be
gained by remaining blind to them."</p>

<p>"You speak as if such a sin were a mere trivial
flaw of character, Sylvia. Why, it is fundamental&mdash;a
crime."</p>

<p>"How can we measure sins and decide which ones
are big and which little? Perhaps Mr. Heath was
horribly tempted to commit this one. We do not
know. We are not his judges. The thing for us
to do is to help him out of the mess he is in."</p>

<p>"Help him?"</p>

<p>"Get him off. Aid him to escape."</p>

<p>"Believing him guilty&mdash;you would do that?"</p>

<p>"Surely I would."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean you would help him to evade the law?
The punishment such wrongdoing merits?"</p>

<p>Emphatically, Sylvia nodded her curls.</p>

<p>"I'd help him to get away from those who are
tracking him down just as I'd help a fox to escape
from the hunters."</p>

<p>"Regardless of right or wrong?"</p>

<p>"Yes. To give him a sporting chance, the start of
those who are after him. You love Stanley Heath.
Don't you want to see him go free?"</p>

<p>"Not if he is guilty."</p>

<p>"Marcia! You mean you would deliver him over
to the law?"</p>

<p>"I would have him deliver himself over."</p>

<p>"As if he would! As if any criminal would."</p>

<p>"A criminal who thought of his soul might."</p>

<p>"But criminals don't think of their souls, dear.
They think only of their bodies&mdash;that's probably
why they are criminals."</p>

<p>Marcia made no answer.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, nobody is going to round up Mr.
Heath if I can prevent it," asserted Sylvia, throwing
back her head. "If you won't help him get
away, I will. He must go in the boat&mdash;now&mdash;today."</p>

<p>"The boat has gone."</p>

<p>"Gone!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Currier arrived this morning after you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
gone and took the boat back to New York with
him."</p>

<p>"And the jewels?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the jewels, too."</p>

<p>"Humph! So that's where they are!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Pretty cute of him to make so neat a get-away!"
commented the girl with admiration. "Currier is,
of course, the understudy&mdash;the accomplice."</p>

<p>Marcia started.</p>

<p>"What sort of man was he? A gentleman, like
Mr. Heath?"</p>

<p>The older woman colored.</p>

<p>"Well, no. At least he&mdash;he&mdash;. Oh, he was
polite and had a nice manner&mdash;a quiet voice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he was different from Mr. Heath&mdash;an inferior&mdash;one
who took orders," interrupted Sylvia.</p>

<p>"I hardly know. I saw very little of him,"
Marcia replied guardedly.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Heath did tell him what to do. Currier
did as he said."</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"In other words, he is the hands and Mr. Heath
the brains of the team."</p>

<p>"How can you, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>Quivering, Marcia shrunk into her chair as if she
had been struck.</p>

<p>"Because I must, Marcia&mdash;because we must both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
look this affair in the face. Confess the circumstances
are suspicious."</p>

<p>"They seem to be," she owned with reluctance.</p>

<p>"They are suspicious."</p>

<p>"That proves nothing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. Nevertheless it is all we have to
go by and we should be fools not to take them at
their face value, shouldn't we? We should at least
consider them."</p>

<p>"Of course we should do that," evaded the
woman.</p>

<p>"Have you considered them?" Sylvia suddenly
inquired.</p>

<p>Marcia drew her hand across her forehead.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;yes. I have thought them over."</p>

<p>"And what conclusion have you arrived at?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand them at all. Nevertheless, I
do not believe Stanley Heath is guilty," was the
proud retort.</p>

<p>"That is because you don't want to&mdash;because
you won't."</p>

<p>"Leave it at that, then, and say I won't," cried
Marcia, leaping defiantly to her feet.</p>

<p>"You are making a great mistake, if you will
pardon me for saying so," Sylvia responded gently.
"You are deliberately closing your eyes and mind
to facts that later are bound to cause you bitter unhappiness.
Let alone the man's guilt. He has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
wife. You seem to forget that. As Elisha Winslow
remarked, you have already been miserable once.
Why be so a second time? Help Stanley Heath to
get out of Wilton and forget him."</p>

<p>"I cannot do either of those things. In the first
place, I have given my word to hand Mr. Heath
over to the authorities. As for forgetting him&mdash;why
ask the impossible?"</p>

<p>Sylvia's patience gave way.</p>

<p>"Go your own way then," she snapped. "Go your
own way and if by and by you regret it&mdash;as you
surely will&mdash;do not blame me. Don't blame me,
either, if I do not agree with you. Stanley Heath
shall never remain here and be betrayed to the law.
I've enough mercy in me to prevent that if you
haven't. Stick to your grim old puritanism if you
must. I'll beat it by a more charitable creed. I'll
help him get away."</p>

<p>She started toward the stairway.</p>

<p>"Sylvia, come back here!" Marcia cried.</p>

<p>"I shall not come back."</p>

<p>"I beg you! Insist!"</p>

<p>The command fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>Marcia rushed after her, but it was too late.</p>

<p>Sylvia was gone.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XVII" id="Chapter_XVII">Chapter XVII</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Stanley</span> Heath was lying with expectant face
turned toward the door when Sylvia entered.</p>

<p>"What's the rumpus?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You heard?"</p>

<p>"Heard? Certainly I heard," he laughed. "I
could not hear what was said, of course, but anyone
within five miles could have heard those men roaring
at one another. What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"The trouble is you," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Didn't you expect trouble sometime?"</p>

<p>"We all must expect trouble sooner or later, I
suppose," was the enigmatic answer. "To just
what particular variety of trouble did you refer?"</p>

<p>"I guess you know. There is no use mincing
matters or beating about the bush. We haven't the
time to waste. The jewels have gone and you must
go, too."</p>

<p>The man looked dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Don't misunderstand me, please," Sylvia rushed
on. "I'm not blaming you&mdash;nor judging you. I
don't know why you took them. You may have
been tempted beyond your strength. You may
have needed money sorely. All that is none of my
business."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"You believe I stole them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do."</p>

<p>"Suppose I didn't?"</p>

<p>"I expected you'd say that," was the calm retort.
"Let it go that way if you prefer. I don't mind.
What I want to do is to help you to get away."</p>

<p>"Even if I am guilty."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Because you're sick and in a trap; because I&mdash;I&mdash;well&mdash;"
she faltered, her lips trembling, "I
just can't bear to have that mean little sheriff who's
after you catch you."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>Startled, Heath sat up.</p>

<p>"That wretched Elisha Winslow who came here
this morning with Eleazer Crocker tagging at his
heels. In some way they had found out about the
jewels and where you had hidden them. Prying
into other people's affairs, no doubt, when they
would have much better minded their own business.
Well, it doesn't matter how they found out. They
know the truth, which is the important thing. They
even attempted to come upstairs and arrest you
post haste; but Marcia wouldn't allow it."</p>

<p>"Marcia!" he spoke the name softly. "She
heard the story, too?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor Marcia!"</p>

<p>"You may well say poor Marcia," Sylvia echoed
sarcastically. "You have made her most unhappy.
Oh, Mr. Heath, Marcia has not had the sort of life
that I told you she had. She has been wretched&mdash;miserable.
Go away before you heap more suffering
upon her. She is fighting to make something of her
wrecked life. Leave her and let her make it. I'll
help you get out of town. I am sure we can devise a
plan. I'll row you across to the mainland and contrive
somehow to get you safely aboard a train. If
we only had a car&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My car is at the Wilton garage."</p>

<p>"Oh, then it will be easy," exclaimed she with
evident relief.</p>

<p>"Not so easy as it seems."</p>

<p>Heath held up his bandaged hand.</p>

<p>"I doubt if I could drive any distance with this
wrist," he said. "Of course it is on the mend.
Nevertheless, it is still stiff from disuse, and pretty
clumsy."</p>

<p>"Couldn't I drive? I've driven quite a lot. What
make is your car?"</p>

<p>"A Buick."</p>

<p>"I've never driven one of those. I wonder if I'd
dare try? How I wish Hortie were here! He could
drive it. He can drive anything."</p>

<p>"Hortie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Horatio Fuller&mdash;a man I know out west. If
only he wasn't so far away! He'd help us in a minute.
He'd do it and ask no questions. That's what
we need&mdash;someone who'll ask no questions."</p>

<p>She frowned, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, no matter. We can find somebody, I am
sure&mdash;especially if we pay them liberally. I'll see
what I can do."</p>

<p>"Wait just a moment. What does Marcia say?"</p>

<p>"Marcia? Oh, you must not listen to Marcia.
She is too much upset to be depended on. She cannot
see the case at all as it is. Her advice wouldn't
be worth twopence. Trust me in this, please. Trust
me, Mr. Heath. I promise you I'll stand by you
to the last ditch. I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>"I think I'd better talk with Marcia first."</p>

<p>"Don't! It will only be a waste of time."</p>

<p>"Still, I must hear what she has to say."</p>

<p>"You won't like it. Marcia is hard, merciless.
Her conscience drives her to extremes. Even should
you get her opinion, you would not follow it."</p>

<p>"What makes you so sure I wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Because it would be madness, sheer madness.
You'll realize that, as I do," insisted Sylvia with
an impatient tapping of her foot. "Marcia stubbornly
shuts her mind to the truth and will only look
on one side. She just repeats the same words over
and over again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"What words?"</p>

<p>"I shall not tell you."</p>

<p>"Then she must tell me herself. Will you ask
her to come up, please?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not."</p>

<p>"You prefer I should call her?"</p>

<p>Baffled, the girl turned away.</p>

<p>"No. I'll send her to you&mdash;if I must. But
remember, I warned you."</p>

<p>"I shall not soon forget that, Sylvia, nor the
splendid loyalty you've shown today. I shall always
remember it. Whatever happens, please realize
that I am grateful," Heath said earnestly. Then
in less serious vein he added: "I never dreamed you
were such a valiant little fighter."</p>

<p>His smile, irresistible in brightness, brought a
faint, involuntary reflection into Sylvia's clouded
countenance.</p>

<p>"Oh. I can fight for people&mdash;when I care," cried
she, impulsively.</p>

<p>Did the artless confession, the blush that accompanied
it, soften the voice of the man so observantly
watching until it unconsciously took on
the fond, caressing tone one uses toward a child?</p>

<p>"So I see. Run along now, little girl, and fetch
Marcia."</p>

<p>"I wish I could make you promise not to listen to
her," coaxed Sylvia, making one last wistful appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot promise that."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. You'd be wiser if you did."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was some moments before Marcia answered
the summons and when at last she came, it was with
downcast eyes and evident reluctance.</p>

<p>"You sent for me?" she said, halting stiffly at
the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>"Won't you please sit down?" Heath replied.</p>

<p>"I've only a few moments. I'd rather stand."</p>

<p>"But I cannot say what I wish to say while you
flutter there as if poised for flight," urged the man,
annoyance discernible in his husky voice.</p>

<p>Unwillingly Marcia slipped into the chair beside
him.</p>

<p>"That's better," he said, smiling. "Now tell me
exactly what happened down stairs."</p>

<p>"Didn't Sylvia tell you?"</p>

<p>"She told me something. I want your version of
the story."</p>

<p>As if realizing the futility, both of protest and
evasion, the woman let her gaze travel to the dim
purple line where sea met sky and began to speak.</p>

<p>She related the incident tersely; without comment;
and in a dull, impersonal manner.</p>

<p>Stanley Heath, scrutinizing her with keen, appraising
eyes, could not but note the pallor of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
cheeks, the unsteadiness of her lips, the nervous
clasping and unclasping of her hands.</p>

<p>The narrative concluded, her glance dropped to
the floor and silence fell between them.</p>

<p>"And that is all?" he inquired when convinced
she had no intention of speaking further.</p>

<p>"That is all."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Now what had I better do?"</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>"What do you think it best for me to do?" he
repeated.</p>

<p>"Best? How do you mean&mdash;best? Best for
your body or best for your soul?"</p>

<p>"For both."</p>

<p>"But suppose the two should not coincide?"</p>

<p>"Then I must reconcile them or choose between
them."</p>

<p>"You cannot reconcile them."</p>

<p>"Choose between them then&mdash;compromise."</p>

<p>At the word, he saw her shiver.</p>

<p>"Well, you are not advising me," he persisted
when she offered no reply.</p>

<p>"How can I? You know your own affairs&mdash;know
the truth and yourself far better than I."</p>

<p>"Granting all that, nevertheless, I should like your
opinion."</p>

<p>"You will not thank me for it," cautioned she,
bitterly. "Sylvia says I am quixotic, impractical."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind Sylvia. Tell me what you think."</p>

<p>"But how can I give a just opinion? I cannot
judge," she burst out as if goaded beyond her patience.
"I know none of the facts. To judge the
conduct of another, one must know every influence
that contributed to the final catastrophe. No person
but God Himself can know that."</p>

<p>A radiance, swift as the passage of a meteor,
flashed across Stanley Heath's face and was gone.</p>

<p>"Suppose you yourself had taken these jewels and
were placed in this dilemma?" pressed he.</p>

<p>"That would be entirely different."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The case would not be similar at all."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Heath reiterated.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because I should be guilty."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not believe you took the jewels," was the
quiet answer.</p>

<p>"Marcia! Marcia!" He reached for her hand,
then sharply checked the gesture. "Why don't you
believe I took them?"</p>

<p>"It isn't like you."</p>

<p>"The evidence is against me&mdash;every whit of it."</p>

<p>"I cannot help that."</p>

<p>"Have I ever told you I did not take them?
Ever led you to suppose me innocent?"</p>

<p>"You have never told me anything about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have never asked."</p>

<p>"As if I should put to you a question like that,"
she said proudly.</p>

<p>"You had the right to inquire."</p>

<p>"I did not need to."</p>

<p>Once again the man restrained an impulse to
imprison her hands in his.</p>

<p>"Suppose I did take them?" he went on in an
even, coolly modulated voice. "Suppose the case
stands exactly as this shrewd-eyed Wilton sheriff
suspects it does? What am I to do?"</p>

<p>He saw the color drain from her face.</p>

<p>"I only know what I should do, were I in your
place."</p>

<p>"Tell me that."</p>

<p>"I should go through with it&mdash;clear my soul of
guilt."</p>

<p>"And afterward?"</p>

<p>"Start over again."</p>

<p>"That would be very difficult. The stigma of
crime clings to a man. Its stamp remains on him,
try as he will to shake it off. My life would be
ruined were I to pursue such a course."</p>

<p>"Not your real life. You would, of course, lose
standing among your supposed friends; but you
would not lose it among those whose regard went
deeper. Even if you did&mdash;what would it matter?"</p>

<p>"But to be alone, friendless! Who would help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
me piece together the mangled fragments of such a
past&mdash;for I should need help; I could not do it
alone? Do you imagine that in all the world there
would be even one person whose loyalty and affection
would survive so acid a test?"</p>

<p>"There might be," she murmured, turning away
her head.</p>

<p>"Even so, would I have the presumption to accept
such a service? The right to impose on a devotion
so self-effacing?"</p>

<p>"The person might be glad, proud to help you&mdash;consider
it a privilege."</p>

<p>"Who would, Marcia? Do you know of anyone?"</p>

<p>She leaped to her feet.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me?" she demanded, the gentleness
of her voice chilling to curtness. "You have
such a helpmate near you&mdash;or should have."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," pleaded the man, puzzled
by her change of mood.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'd better not go into that now," was
her response. "It is beside the point."</p>

<p>"On the contrary it is the point."</p>

<p>"I don't see how. What happens after the penalty
has been paid has nothing to do with the paying
of it."</p>

<p>"In this case it has everything."</p>

<p>"I cannot stay," she whispered, frightened by his
insistence. "I must go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait just a moment."</p>

<p>"I cannot. I must get dinner."</p>

<p>"Never mind the dinner!"</p>

<p>She looked at him then for the first time.</p>

<p>"We have to eat," she declared making an attempt
at lightness.</p>

<p>"Not always. Sometimes there are things more
important."</p>

<p>"To think of a man saying that!"</p>

<p>The ring of the telephone chimed in with her silvery
laughter.</p>

<p>"I'll go, Sylvia," she called with a promptness
that indicated the interruption was a welcome one.</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, this is Mrs. Howe at Wilton.</p>

<p>"It's long distance," she called to Heath. "New
York is on the line.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is here. He can speak with you himself.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Heath wishes to speak with you," she announced
formally. "Slip on your bathrobe and
come."</p>

<p>Heath took the receiver from her hand.</p>

<p>"Joan? This certainly is good of you, dear. Yes,
I am much better, thank you. Bless your precious
heart, you needn't have worried. Currier will be
back late tonight or early tomorrow morning and
he will tell you how well I am progressing. Yes, he
has the jewels. Put them in the safe right away,
won't you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't say when I shall be home. Something
has come up that may keep me here some time. I
cannot explain just now. It is the thing you have
always predicted would happen to me sometime.
Well, it has happened. Do you get that? Yes, I
am caught&mdash;hard and fast. It is a bit ironic to
have traveled all over the world and then be taken
captive in a small Cape Cod village. I guess I believe
in Fate, destiny&mdash;whatever you call it.</p>

<p>"I'm in something of a tangle just at present. I
may even have to call on you to help me straighten
it out. That's sweet of you, dear. You've never
failed me. Oh, I can talk&mdash;it doesn't hurt me.
You mustn't mind my croak. I'm not so badly off as
I sound. I'll let you know the first minute I have
anything definite to tell.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, dear. Take care of yourself. It's done
me a world of good to hear your voice."</p>

<p>Heath returned the receiver to its hook and in high
spirits strode back into his room.</p>

<p>If, however, he hoped there to take up the threads
of the conversation so unexpectedly broken off, he
was disappointed.</p>

<p>Marcia's chair was empty.</p>

<p>She was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="Chapter_XVIII" id="Chapter_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days immediately following were like an armed
truce.</p>

<p>Marcia watched Sylvia.</p>

<p>Sylvia watched Marcia.</p>

<p>Heath watched them both.</p>

<p>When, however, no further reference to the events
of the past week was made, the tension slowly began
to lessen, and life at the Howe Homestead took on
again its customary aspect.</p>

<p>One agency in this return to normal was the physical
improvement of the invalid, who as a result of
rest, fresh air, sleep, and good nursing now became
well enough to come down stairs and join the family
group.</p>

<p>An additional, and by no means unimportant contributory
factor, was the sudden onrush of fine
weather.</p>

<p>Never had there been such a spring&mdash;at least
never within the memory of the owner of the
house on the Point. The soft breath of the south
wind; the radiance of the sunshine; the gentle lapping
of the waves on the spangled shore; the stillness;
the vivid beauty of the ocean's changing
colors&mdash;all these blended to make a world that
caught the breath and subordinated every mood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
save one of exuberant joy.</p>

<p>Against a heaven gentian blue, snowy gulls
wheeled and dipped, and far beyond them, miniature
white sails cut the penciled indigo of the horizon.</p>

<p>The old grey house with its fan-light and beaded
doorway stood out in colonial simplicity from the
background of sea and sky like a dim, silvered picture,
every angle of it soft in relief against the
splendors that flanked it.</p>

<p>Marcia sang at her work&mdash;sang not so much because
there was peace in her heart as because the
gladness about her forced her to forget her pain.</p>

<p>Sylvia sang, too, or rather whistled in a gay, boyish
fashion and in company with Prince Hal raced
like a young colt up the beach.</p>

<p>Only a day or two more passed before it was possible
to get Stanley Heath, warmly wrapped in rugs,
out on the sheltered veranda where, like the others,
he reveled in the sunshine.</p>

<p>His cheeks bronzed, his eyes became clear and
bright, laughter curled his lips. If just around the
corner the spectre of trouble loitered, its presence
was not, apparently, able to put to flight his lightheartedness.
Over and over again he declared that
every hour spent in this lotus-eaters' country was
worth a miser's fortune.</p>

<p>Sometimes when he lay motionless in the steamer-chair
looking seaward beneath the rim of his soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
felt hat, or following the circling gulls with preoccupied
gaze Marcia, peeping at him from the window
wondered of what he was thinking.</p>

<p>That the fancies which intrigued him were pleasant
and that he enjoyed his own company there could
be no question.</p>

<p>No attitude he might have assumed could have
been better calculated to dispel awkwardness and
force into the background the seriousness of the two
women, whose interests were so inextricably entangled
with his own, than the merry, bantering one
he adopted when with them.</p>

<p>Even Marcia, who at first had avoided all tête-à-têtes,
quivering with dread whenever she found herself
alone with him, gradually, beneath the spell of
his new self, gained sufficient confidence to perch
hatless on the piazza rail beside him in an unoccupied
moment and spar with him, verbally.</p>

<p>For he was a brilliant talker&mdash;one who gave unexpected,
original twists to the conversation&mdash;twists
that taxed one's power of repartee. The challenge
to keep pace with his wit was to her like scouring a
long disused rapier and seeing it clash against the
deft blade of a master fencer.</p>

<p>Here indeed was a hitherto undreamed-of Stanley
Heath, a man whose dangerous charms had multiplied
a hundredfold and who, if he had captivated
her before now riveted her fetters with every word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
he spoke, every glance he gave her.</p>

<p>She struggled to escape from the snare closing in on
her, then finding combat useless, ceased to struggle
and let herself drift with the tide.</p>

<p>After all, why not enjoy the present?</p>

<p>Soon, all too soon, its glamorous delights would
be gone and she would be back once more in the
uneventful past which had satisfied her and kept
her happy until Heath had crossed her path, bringing
with him the bewildering adventures that had
destroyed her tranquillity.</p>

<p>Would she ever find that former peace, she frequently
asked herself. Would her world ever be the
same after this magician who had touched it with the
spell of his enchantment had left it? For he would
leave it. A time must come, and soon now&mdash;when
like a scene from a fairy play the mystic lights would
fade, the haunting music cease, the glitter of the
whole dreamlike pageant give place to reality.</p>

<p>It was too beautiful, too ephemeral an idyll to
last.</p>

<p>In loving this stranger of whom she knew so
little, she had set her heart upon a phantom that
she knew must vanish. The future, grim with foreboding,
was constantly drawing nearer.</p>

<p>In her path stood a presence that said: Thou shalt
not!</p>

<p>There were, alas, but two ways of life&mdash;the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of right and the way of wrong, and between them
lay no neutral zone. This she acknowledged with her
mind. But her rebel heart would play her false,
flouting her puritan codes and defying the creeds
that conscience dictated.</p>

<p>Meantime while she thus wrestled with the angel
of her best self, Sylvia accepted the situation with
characteristic lightness. Her life in this vast world
and wide had been of short duration, but during its
brief span she had learned a surprising amount about
the earth and the human beings that peopled it.</p>

<p>She knew more already about men than did
Marcia&mdash;much more. Long ago they had ceased
to be gods to her. She was accustomed to them and
their ways, and was never at a loss to give back
to each as good as he sent&mdash;frequently better.</p>

<p>Her sophistication in the present instance greatly
relieved the strain.</p>

<p>She jested fearlessly with Heath, speaking a language
with which he was familiar and one that
amused him no end.</p>

<p>Often he would sit watching her furtively, his
glance moving from the gold of her hair to the blue
of her eyes, the fine poise of her fair white throat,
the slender lines of her girlish figure. Often, too,
in such moments he would think of the possibilities
that lay in the prodigal beauty she so heedlessly
ignored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>That he took pleasure in being with her and treating
her with half playful, half affectionate admiration
was incontestable. Yet notwithstanding this,
his fondness was nicely restrained and never slipped
into familiarity or license.</p>

<p>It was the sort of delicately poised relation in
which the girl was thoroughly at home and with
which she knew well how to cope.</p>

<p>Today Heath was taking his first walk and the
two had strolled down to the water's edge where
deep in a conversation more serious than usual they
sat in the sun on the over-turned yellow dory.</p>

<p>To Marcia, watching from the porch, they appeared
to be arguing&mdash;Sylvia pleadingly, Heath
with stern resistance.</p>

<p>The woman could not but speculate as to the
subject that engrossed them.</p>

<p>Not that she was spying. She would have scorned
to do that.</p>

<p>She had merely stepped outside to shake a duster
and they had caught her eye. It seemed, too, that
she had chosen an inopportune moment for observation,
for just at that instant Sylvia placed her hand
entreatingly on Heath's arm and though he continued
to talk, he caught and held it.</p>

<p>The fact that Sylvia neither evinced surprise, nor
withdrew it forced her to the disconcerting conclusion
that the thing was no unusual happening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Marcia turned aside, jealousy clutching at her
heart.</p>

<p>When, later in the day, the pair reëntered the
house Heath, with a few pleasant words, caught up
his overcoat and went out onto the steps to smoke,
while Sylvia hurried to her room.</p>

<p>Marcia, passing through the hall, could see her
golden head bent over the table as intent with pen
and paper she dashed off page after page of a closely
written letter.</p>

<p>It was a pity the elder woman could not have read
that letter, for had she been able to, it would not
only have astonished but also have enlightened her
and perhaps quieted the beating of her troubled
heart.</p>

<p>It was a letter that astonished Sylvia herself.
Nevertheless, much as it surprised her, her amazement
in no way approached that of young Horatio
Fuller when he read it.</p>

<p>So completely did it scatter to the winds of heaven
every other thought his youthful head contained that
he posted two important business documents&mdash;one
without a stamp, and the other without an address.
After that he decided he was unfit to cope with commercial
duties and pleading a headache hastened
home to his mother.</p>

<p>Now Horatio's mother, far from possessing the appearance
of a tower of strength to which one might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
flee in time of trouble, was a woman of colorless,
vaguely defined personality indicative of little guile
and still less determination. She listened well and
gave the impression she could listen, with her hands
passively folded in her lap, forever if necessary. She
never interrupted; never offered comment or advice;
never promised anything; and yet when she said, as
she invariably did, "I'll talk with your father, dear,"
there was always infinite comfort in the observation.</p>

<p>That was what she said today to Horatio Junior.</p>

<p>Accordingly that evening after Horatio Senior had
dined, and dined well; after he had smoked a good
cigar and with no small measure of pride in his own
skill put into place all the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle
that had defied his prowess the night before&mdash;his
wife artfully slipping them beneath his nose where
he could not fail to find them&mdash;then and not until
then did Mrs. Horatio take out the pink afghan she
had been making and while she knit two and purled
two, she gently imparted to Alton City's leading citizen
the intelligence that his son, Horatio Junior,
wished to go East; that he was in love; that, in short,
he wished to marry.</p>

<p>Up into the air like a whizzing rocket soared Horatio
Senior!</p>

<p>He raged; he tramped the floor; he heaped on the
head of the absent Horatio Junior every epithet of
reproach his wrath could devise, the phrases drivel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>ing idiot and audacious puppy appearing to afford
him the greatest measure of relief. Continuing his
harangue, he threatened to disinherit his son; he
smoked four cigarettes in succession; he tipped over
the Boston fern. The rest of the things Horatio
Senior said and what he did would not only be too
gross to write down in the Chronicles of the Kings
of Judah, but also would be improper to record here.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mrs. Horatio knitted on.</p>

<p>At last when breathless and panting Horatio Senior,
like an alarm clock ran down and sank exhausted
into his chair, Mrs. Horatio began the second row of
knit two, purl two and ventured the irrefutable observation
that after all Horatio Junior was their only
child.</p>

<p>As this could not be denied, it passed without challenge
and gaining confidence to venture farther, she
presently added, quite casually that a wife was a
steadying influence in a young man's career.</p>

<p>Horatio Senior vouchsafed no reply. Perhaps he
had no breath left to demur.</p>

<p>At any rate his wife, considering silence a favorable
symptom, followed up her previous comments
with the declaration that Sylvia Hayden was a nice
little thing. This drew fire.</p>

<p>Horatio Senior sputtered something about "nothing
but a penniless school-teacher&mdash;a nobody."</p>

<p>Very deliberately then Mrs. Horatio began the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
fourth row of her knitting and as her needles clicked
off the stitches, she murmured pleasantly that if she
remembered rightly this had been the very objection
Horatio Senior's father had made to their own marriage.</p>

<p>At this Horatio Senior flushed scarlet and said
promptly that fathers did not know anything about
choosing wives for their sons; that his marriage had
been ideal; that his Jennie had been the one wife in
the world for him; that time had proved it&mdash;even
to his parents; that she was the only person on earth
who really understood him&mdash;which latter statement
unquestionably demonstrated that all that proceeded
out of the mouth of Horatio Senior was not vanity
and vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>After this nothing was simpler than to complete
the pink stripe and discuss just when Horatio Junior
had better start East.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Had Sylvia dreamed when she licked the envelope's
flap with her small red tongue and smoothed
it down with her pretty white finger she was thus
loosing Alton City's thunderbolts, she might, perhaps,
have hesitated to send the letter she had
penned and perhaps would not have started off so
jauntily late that afternoon to post it.</p>

<p>As it was, she was ignorant of the future conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>quences of her act and went skipping across the wee
azure pools the tide had left behind as gaily as if she
were not making history.</p>

<p>And not only did she go swinging off in this carefree
fashion, but toward six o'clock she telephoned
she was at the Doanes and Henry and his mother&mdash;the
little old lady she had met on the train the day
she arrived&mdash;wanted her to stay to supper. He
would bring her home early in the evening. There
would be a moon&mdash;Marcia need not worry.</p>

<p>Marcia had not thought of worrying until that
minute, but now, in spite of knowing Sylvia was safe
and in good hands she began, paradoxically enough,
to worry madly.</p>

<p>Her heart would palpitate, her hand tremble while
she spread the cloth and prepared the supper; and
when she could not put off the dreaded and yet anticipated
moment any longer, timidly as a girl she
summoned Stanley Heath to the small, round table.</p>

<p>"Sylvia isn't coming," she explained, all blushes.
"She telephoned she was going to stay over in town."</p>

<p>They seated themselves.</p>

<p>It was the first time they had ever been alone at a
meal and the novelty of finding themselves opposite
one another awed them into silence.</p>

<p>"Would you&mdash;do you care for cheese soufflé?"
stammered Marcia.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't like cheese."</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;very much."</p>

<p>"I hope it is done."</p>

<p>"It is perfect."</p>

<p>"It's hard to get it out of the oven at the right
moment. Sometimes it falls."</p>

<p>"This one hasn't," beamed Stanley.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Perhaps I might have left it in a
second or two longer."</p>

<p>"It's wonderful!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it. Rolls?"</p>

<p>"Rather! My, but you are a marvelous cook."</p>

<p>"Oh, not really. You're hungry&mdash;that's all.
Things taste good when you are."</p>

<p>"It isn't that. Everything you put your hand to
is well done."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"It isn't nonsense and you know it. You're a
marvelous person, Marcia."</p>

<p>"There is nothing marvelous about me."</p>

<p>"There is&mdash;your eyes, for one thing. Don't drop
them, dear. I want to look at them."</p>

<p>"You are talking foolishness."</p>

<p>"Every man talks foolishness once in his life, I
suppose. Perhaps I am talking it tonight because
our time together is so short. I am leaving here tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Stanley!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Across the table he caught her hand.</p>

<p>"I am well now and have no further excuse for
imposing on your hospitality."</p>

<p>"As if it were imposing!"</p>

<p>"It is. I have accepted every manner of kindness
from you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't call it that," she interrupted.</p>

<p>"What else can I call it? I was a stranger and
you took me in. It was sweet of you&mdash;especially
when you knew nothing about me. Now the time
has come for me to go. Tomorrow morning I am
giving myself up to the Wilton sheriff."</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"But you said you wanted me to. It is the only
square thing to do, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>He rose and came to her side, slipping an arm
about her.</p>

<p>"Marcia. Dearest! I am doing what you wish,
am I not?"</p>

<p>"I cannot bear it." The words were sharp with
pain.</p>

<p>"You wanted me to go through with it."</p>

<p>She covered her face and he felt a shudder pass
over her.</p>

<p>"Yes. But that was then," she whispered.</p>

<p>At the words, he drew her to her feet and into his
arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Marcia, beloved! Oh, my dear one, do I need to
tell you I love you&mdash;love you with all my heart&mdash;my
soul&mdash;all that is in me? You know it&mdash;know
that every moment we have been together has been
heaven. Tell me you love me, dear&mdash;for you do
love me. Don't deny it&mdash;not tonight&mdash;our last
night together. Say that you love me."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;know," she faltered, her arms creeping
about his neck.</p>

<p>He kissed her then&mdash;her hair, her eyes, her neck,
her lips&mdash;long, burning kisses that left her quivering
beneath the rush of them.</p>

<p>Their passion brought her to herself and she drew
away.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We can't. We must not. I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"Forgotten?"</p>

<p>"Something stands between us&mdash;we have no
right. Forgive me."</p>

<p>"But my dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have no right," she repeated.</p>

<p>"You are thinking of the past," he challenged.
"Marcia, the past is dead. It is the present only in
which we live&mdash;the present&mdash;just us two&mdash;who
love."</p>

<p>"We must not love."</p>

<p>"But we do, sweetheart," was his triumphant cry.
"We do!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must forget."</p>

<p>"Can you forget?" he reproached.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;can try."</p>

<p>"Ah, your tongue is too honest, Marcia. You
cannot forget. Neither can I. Our pledge is given.
We belong to one another. I shall not surrender
what is mine&mdash;never."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let us not talk of tomorrow."</p>

<p>"We must. We shall be parted then."</p>

<p>"Only for a little while. I shall come back to you.
Our love will hold. Absence, distance, nothing can
part us&mdash;not really."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then tell me you love me so I may leave knowing
the truth from your own sweet lips."</p>

<p>"I love you, Stanley&mdash;God help me!"</p>

<p>"Ah, now I can go! It will not be for long."</p>

<p>"It must be for forever, dear heart. You must
not come back. Tonight must be&mdash;the end."</p>

<p>"Marcia!"</p>

<p>"Tonight must be the end," she repeated, turning
away.</p>

<p>"You mean you cannot face tomorrow&mdash;the disgrace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean tonight must be the end," she reiterated.</p>

<p>Through narrowed lids, he looked at her, scanning
her averted face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she heard him laugh bitterly, discordantly.</p>

<p>"So we have come to the Great Divide, have we?"
he said. "I have, apparently, expected too much of
you. I might have known it would be so. All women
are alike. They desert a man when he needs them
most. Their affection has no toughness of fibre. It
snaps under the first severe strain. The prospect of
sharing my shame is more than you can bear." Again
he laughed. "Well, tonight shall be the end&mdash;tonight&mdash;now.
Don't think I blame you. It is not
your fault. I merely rated you too high, Marcia&mdash;believed
you a bigger woman than you are, that's all.
I have asked more than you were capable of giving.
The mistake was mine&mdash;not yours."</p>

<p>He left her then.</p>

<p>Stunned by the torrent of his reproach, she stood
motionless, watching while, without a backward
glance, he passed into the hall and up the stairs. His
receding footsteps grew fainter.</p>

<p>Even after he was out of sight, she remained immovable,
her frightened eyes riveted on the doorway
through which he had disappeared.</p>

<p>Prince Hal raised his head and sensing all was not
well came uneasily to her side and, thrusting his nose
into her inert hand, whined.</p>

<p>At his touch, something within her gave way. She
swayed, caught at a chair and shrank into it, her body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
shaking and her breath coming in gasping, hysterical
sobs.</p>

<p>The clock ticked on, the surf broke in muffled undertone,
the light faded; the candles burned lower,
flickered and overflowed the old pewter candle sticks;
and still she sat there, her tearless, dilated eyes fixed
straight before her and the setter crouching unnoticed
at her feet.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIX" id="Chapter_XIX">Chapter XIX</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>, bubbling over with sociability after her
evening at the Doanes', was surprised, on reaching
the Homestead, to find a lamp set in the window and
the living-room empty. Ten o'clock was not late and
yet both occupants of the house had gone upstairs.</p>

<p>This was unusual.</p>

<p>She wondered at it.</p>

<p>Certainly Marcia could not be asleep at so early
an hour; nor Heath, either. In fact, beneath the
latter's door she could see a streak of light, and
could hear him moving about inside.</p>

<p>Marcia's room, on the other hand, was still. Once,
as she paused listening, wondering whether she
dared knock and go in for a bedtime chat, she
thought she detected a stifled sound and thus encouraged
whispered the woman's name. No response
came, however, and deciding she must have been
mistaken she tiptoed away.</p>

<p>Having, therefore, no inkling of a change in the
delightful relations that had for the past week prevailed,
the atmosphere that greeted her when she
came down the next morning was a shock.</p>

<p>Stanley Heath stood at the telephone talking to
Elisha Winslow and on the porch outside were
grouped his suit-case, overcoat and traveling rug.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
He himself was civil&mdash;nay, courteous&mdash;but was
plainly ill at ease and had little except the most commonplace
remarks to offer in way of conversation.</p>

<p>Marcia had not slept, as her pallor and the violet
shadows beneath her eyes attested.</p>

<p>Sylvia could see that her duties as hostess of the
breakfast table taxed her self-control almost to the
breaking point and that only her pride and strong
will-power prevented her from going to pieces.</p>

<p>Although the girl did not understand, she sensed
Marcia's need of her and rushed valiantly into the
breach&mdash;filling every awkward pause with her customary
sparkling chatter.</p>

<p>Her impulse was to cry out:</p>

<p>"What under the sun is the matter with you
two?"</p>

<p>She might have done so had not a dynamic quality
vibrant in the air warned her not to meddle.</p>

<p>When at length the meal was cut short by the arrival
of Elisha Winslow, all three of the group rose
with unconcealed relief.</p>

<p>Even Elisha's presence, hateful as it would ordinarily
have been, came now as a welcome interruption.</p>

<p>"Wal, Mr. Heath, I see you're expectin' me,"
grinned the sheriff, pointing toward the luggage beside
the door.</p>

<p>"I am, Mr. Winslow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got my boat. Are you ready to come right
along?"</p>

<p>"Quite ready."</p>

<p>Heath went to Sylvia and took her hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," murmured he formally,
"for all you've done for me. I appreciate it more
than I can say. And you, too, Mrs. Howe. Your
kindness has placed me deeply in your debt."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck, Mr. Heath," called Sylvia.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"And I, too," Marcia rejoined in a voice scarcely
audible.</p>

<p>To this the man offered no reply.</p>

<p>Perhaps he did not hear the words.</p>

<p>They followed him to the door.</p>

<p>It was then that Marcia sprang forward and
caught Elisha's arm.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking him, Elisha?" she demanded,
a catch in her voice. "Where are you taking
him? Remember, Mr. Heath has been ill. You
must not risk his getting cold or suffering any discomfort.
Promise me you will not."</p>

<p>"You need have no worries on that score, Marcia,"
replied the sheriff kindly, noticing the distress in
her face. "You don't, naturally, want all you've
done for Mr. Heath thrown away. No more do I.
I'll look out for him."</p>

<p>"Where is he going?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"To my house for the present," Elisha answered.
"You see, the town ain't ever needed to make provision
for a criminal. I can't lock him up in the
church 'cause he could get out had he the mind;
an' out of the school-house, too. Besides, them
buildin's are kinder chilly. So after weighin' the
matter, I decided to take him 'long home with me.
I've a comfortable spare room an' I figger to put
him in it 'til I've questioned him an' verified his
story.</p>

<p>"Meantime, nobody in town will be the wiser. I
ain't even tellin' May Ellen why Mr. Heath's at
the house. If I choose to harbor comp'ny, that's my
business. Not a soul 'cept Eleazer's in on this affair
an' he's keepin' mum. When him an' me decide
we've got the truth, we'll act&mdash;not before."</p>

<p>"That relieves my mind very much. Mr. Heath
is&mdash;you see he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's a friend of yours&mdash;I ain't forgettin' that.
I shall treat him 'cordin'ly, Marcia."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Elisha&mdash;thank you a hundred
times."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said.</p>

<p>Heath bowed once again and the two men walked
down to the float where they clambered with the
luggage into Elisha's dory and put out into the
channel.</p>

<p>Sylvia loitered to wave her hand and watch them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
row away, but Marcia, as if unable to bear the sight,
waited for no further farewell.</p>

<p>Even after the girl had followed her indoors and
during the interval they washed the breakfast dishes
together, Sylvia did not venture to ask any explanations.
If Marcia preferred to exclude her from her
confidence, she resolved not to intrude.</p>

<p>Instead, she began to talk of her evening with
the Doanes and although well aware Marcia scarcely
listened, her gossip bridged the gulf of silence and
gave the elder woman opportunity to recover her
poise.</p>

<p>By noon Marcia was, to outward appearances,
entirely herself. She had not been able, to be sure, to
banish her pallor or the traces of sleeplessness; but
she had her emotions sufficiently under control to
talk pleasantly, if not gaily so that only an understanding,
lynx-eyed observer like Sylvia would have
suspected she was still keyed to too high a pitch to
put heart in what she mechanically said and did.</p>

<p>That day and the next passed in much the same
strained fashion.</p>

<p>That the woman was grateful for her niece's
forbearance was evident in a score of trivial ways.
That she also sensed Sylvia's solicitude and appreciated
her loyalty and impulsive outbursts of affection
was also obvious.</p>

<p>It was not until the third morning, however, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the barriers between the two collapsed.</p>

<p>Marcia had gone into the living-room to write
a letter&mdash;a duty she especially detested and one
which it was her habit to shunt into the future whenever
possible.</p>

<p>Today, alas, there was no escape. A business communication
had come that must be answered.</p>

<p>She sat down before the infrequently used desk
and started to take up her pen when Sylvia heard
her utter a cry.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, dear?" called the girl, hurrying
into the other room.</p>

<p>No answer came.</p>

<p>Marcia was sitting fingering a slip of green paper
she had taken from a long envelope.</p>

<p>With wild, despairing eyes she regarded it.</p>

<p>Then, as Sylvia came nearer, she bowed her head
upon the desk and began to sob as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>"Marcia, dear&mdash;Marcia&mdash;what is it?" cried
Sylvia, rushing to her and clasping the shaking figure
in her arms. "Tell me what it is, dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, how could he!" moaned the woman. "How
could he be so cruel!"</p>

<p>"What has happened. Marcia?"</p>

<p>"Stanley&mdash;he has left a check&mdash;money&mdash;thrown
it in my face! And I did it so gladly&mdash;because
I loved him. He knew that. Yet he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
leave this&mdash;pay me&mdash;as if I were a common servant.
I had rather he struck me&mdash;a hundred times
rather."</p>

<p>The girl took the check.</p>

<p>It was filled out in Stanley Heath's clear, strong
hand and was for the sum of a hundred dollars.</p>

<p>"How detestable of him!" she exclaimed. "Tell
me, Marcia&mdash;what happened between you and Mr.
Heath? You quarreled&mdash;of course I know that.
But why&mdash;why? I have not wanted to ask, but
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you everything, Sylvia. I'd rather you
knew. I thought at first I could keep it to myself,
but I cannot. I need you to help me, dear."</p>

<p>"If I only could!" murmured Sylvia, drawing
her closer.</p>

<p>As if quieted by the warmth of her embrace,
Marcia wiped her eyes and began to speak, tremulously.</p>

<p>She unfolded the story of her blind faith in Stanley
Heath; her love for him&mdash;a love she could neither
resist nor control&mdash;a love she had known from the
first to be hopeless. She confessed how she had
fought against his magnetic power; how she had
struggled to conceal her feelings; how he himself
had resisted a similar attraction in her; how at last
he had discovered her secret and forced her to betray
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly, reluctantly she went on to tell of the final
scene between them&mdash;his insistence on coming back
to her.</p>

<p>"Of course I realized we could not go on," she
explained bravely. "That we loved one another was
calamity enough. All that remained was for him
to go away and forget me&mdash;return to his wife, his
home, and the interests and obligations of his former
life. Soon, if he honestly tries, this infatuation will
pass and everything will be as before. Men forget
more easily than women. Absence, too, will help."</p>

<p>"And you, Marcia?"</p>

<p>"I am free. There is no law forbidding me to remember.
I can go on caring, so long as he does not
know. It will do no harm if here, far away, where
he will never suspect it, I continue to love him."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear!"</p>

<p>"I cannot give up my love. It is all I have now.
Oh, I do not mean to mourn over it, pity myself,
make life unhappy. Instead, I shall be glad, thankful.
You will see. This experience will make every
day of living richer. You need have no fears for
me, Sylvia. You warned me, you know," concluded
she with a pathetic little smile.</p>

<p>"I was a brute! I ought to have shielded you
more," the girl cried. "I could have, had I realized.
Well, I can yet do something, thank heaven. Give
me that check."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?"</p>

<p>"Return it, of course&mdash;return it before Stanley
Heath leaves town. Isn't that what you want done?
Surely you do not wish to keep it."</p>

<p>"No! No!"</p>

<p>"I'll take it over to Elisha Winslow's now, this
minute."</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;yes, probably that will be best. You
won't, I suppose, be allowed to see Stanley," speculated
she timidly.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose so."</p>

<p>"If you should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Don't say anything harsh, Sylvia. Please do
not blame him, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll wring his neck!" was the emphatic retort.</p>

<p>"Oh, please&mdash;please dear&mdash;for my sake! I
can't let you go if you go in that spirit," pleaded
Marcia in alarm.</p>

<p>"There, there&mdash;you need not worry for fear I
shall maltreat your Romeo, richly as he deserves it,"
was the response. "I could kill him&mdash;but I won't&mdash;because
of you. Nevertheless, I warn you that
if I get the chance I shall tell him what I think of
him. No power on earth can keep me from doing
that. He is terribly to blame and ought to realize
it. No married man has any business playing round
with another woman. He may get by with it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
New York, but on Cape Cod or in Alton City," she
drew herself up, "it just isn't done and the sooner
Stanley Heath understands that, the better. That's
that! Now I'll get my hat and go."</p>

<p>"I am half afraid to let you, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"You don't trust me? Don't you believe I love
you?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid you love me too much, dear."</p>

<p>"I do love you, Marcia. I never dreamed I could
care so intensely for anyone I have known for so
short a time. What you did for my mother alone
would make me love you. But aside from gratitude
there are other reasons. I love you for your own
splendid self, dear. Please do not fear to trust me.
I promise you I will neither be unjust nor bitter.
The fact that you care for Stanley Heath shall protect
him and make me merciful."</p>

<p>"Take the check then and go. I wish I were to
see him."</p>

<p>"Well, you're not! Rowing across that channel
and hurrying to his side after the way he's treated
you! Not a bit of it! I'd tie you to your own bedpost
first," snapped Sylvia. "Let him do the explaining
and apologizing. Let him cross the channel
and grovel at your feet. That's what he ought to
do!"</p>

<p>"You won't tell him that."</p>

<p>"I don't know what I shall tell him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please, Sylvia! You promised, remember."</p>

<p>"Don't fret. Some of the mad will be taken out
of me before I see Mr. Heath. The tide is running
strong and it will be a pull to get the boat across to
the mainland. Kiss me and wish me luck, Marcia.
You do believe I will try to be wise, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Yes!"</p>

<p>"That's right. You really can trust me, you know.
I'm not so bad as I sound."</p>

<p>Tucking the check into the wee pocket of her
sweater, Sylvia caught up her pert beret and perched
it upon her curls.</p>

<p>"So long!" she called, looking back over her shoulder
as she opened the door. "So long, Marcia! I'll
be back as soon as ever I can."</p>

<p>The haste with which she disappeared, suddenly
precipitated her into the arms of a young man who
stood upon the steps preparing to knock.</p>

<p>"Hortie Fuller," cried Sylvia breathlessly. "Hortie!
Where on earth did you come from?"</p>

<p>Her arms closed about his neck and he had kissed
her twice before she swiftly withdrew, rearranging
her curls and saying coldly:</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine what brought you here,
Horatio."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="Chapter_XX" id="Chapter_XX">Chapter XX</a></h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I can't</span> imagine," repeated Sylvia, still very rosy
and flustered, but with her most magnificent air,
"what brought you to Wilton&mdash;I really cannot."</p>

<p>"Can't you?" grinned Horatio cheerfully.</p>

<p>"No, I cannot."</p>

<p>From his superior height of six-feet-two, he looked
down at her meager five feet, amusement twinkling
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Sylvia, however, was too intent on patting her
curls into place to heed his glance.</p>

<p>"You wrote me to come, didn't you?" he presently
inquired.</p>

<p>"I wrote you to come!"</p>

<p>"Well, at least you led me to suppose you'd like
it if I were here," persisted Horatio. "Toward the
bottom of page two you said: 'I am positively homesick';
and in the middle of the back of page three
you wrote: 'It seems years since I've seen you.'"</p>

<p>"What if I did?" answered the girl with a disdainful
shrug.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the dimples showed in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"And that isn't all," Horatio went on. "At the
end of page five you wrote: 'Would that you were
here'!"</p>

<p>Sylvia bit her lip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was only a figure of speech&mdash;what is called
poetic license. Writers are always would-ing things:
Would I were a bird; would I were a ring upon that
hand; would I were&mdash;were&mdash;well, almost anything.
But it doesn't mean at all that they would really
like to be those things."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't mean it when you said you
wished I was here."</p>

<p>Horatio was obviously disappointed.</p>

<p>"Why, of course I am pleased to see you, Hortie.
It is very nice of you to come to the Cape to meet
my aunt and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Darn your aunt!" he scowled. "I didn't come
to see her."</p>

<p>"Hush! She's just inside."</p>

<p>"I don't care."</p>

<p>"But you will when you know her. She's darling."</p>

<p>"I am not interested in aunts."</p>

<p>"Take care! I happen to be very keen on this
aunt of mine. If she didn't like you, you might get
sent home. Don't be horrid, Hortie. I truly am
glad you've come. You must make allowance for my
being surprised. I haven't got over it yet. How in
the world did you contrive to get away at this season?
And what sort of a trip did you have?"</p>

<p>"Swell! I stopped overnight in New York at
the Gardeners. Mother wanted me to deliver a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
birthday cake to Estelle who, you may remember, is
the mater's god-daughter. She's a pippin, too. I
hadn't seen her since she graduated from Vassar."</p>

<p>Sylvia listened.</p>

<p>She did not need to be told about the Gardeners.</p>

<p>They had visited Horatio's family more than once
and rumor had it the elders of both families would
be delighted were the young people to make a match
of it.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised you did not stay longer in New
York," Sylvia observed, gazing reflectively at her
white shoe.</p>

<p>"New York wasn't my objective. I came on business,
you see."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>This was not so flattering.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Horatio, "Dad gave me two
months off so I could get married."</p>

<p>This time he got the reaction for which he had
been waiting.</p>

<p>Sylvia jumped.</p>

<p>"I was not aware you were engaged," murmured
she in a formal, far-away tone.</p>

<p>"I'm not," came frankly from Horatio Junior.
"But I'm going to be. In fact I chance to have the
ring with me this minute. Want to see it?"</p>

<p>"I always enjoy looking at jewels," was her cautious
retort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Horatio felt of his many pockets.</p>

<p>"Where on earth did I put that thing?" he muttered.
"Hope I haven't lost it. Oh, here it is."</p>

<p>He took out a tiny velvet case and sprang the
catch.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hortie! Isn't it beautiful!" Sylvia cried.
"It fairly takes away my breath."</p>

<p>"Like it?"</p>

<p>"It is perfectly lovely!"</p>

<p>"Try it on."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't fit me. My hands are too small."</p>

<p>"It's a small ring. Here. Put it on," he urged,
holding it toward her.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I might try it to please you.
But I know it will be too large."</p>

<p>She slipped it on her finger.</p>

<p>"Why, it does fit. How odd!"</p>

<p>"Very odd indeed," he answered drily, as she
reached her hand out into the sun and turned the
diamonds so that they caught the light.</p>

<p>"Looks rather well on, doesn't it?" was his comment.</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful ring."</p>

<p>Horatio, standing behind her, twice extended his
arms as if to gather her into them and twice withdrew
them, deciding the action to be premature.</p>

<p>At length with a determined squaring of his shoul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>ders, he locked his hands behind him and stood
looking on while she continued to twist the ring
this way and that.</p>

<p>"Well," yawned he after an interval, "I suppose
I may as well put it back in the box."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be wiser if I took care of
it for you, Hortie?" suggested she demurely. "You
are dreadfully careless. Only a moment ago you had
no idea where the ring was. If it is on my finger
you'll know exactly."</p>

<p>"Bully idea! So I shall! Now tell me where
you're off to. You were in a frightful hurry when
you burst through that door."</p>

<p>"So I was," agreed Sylvia. "And here I am loitering
and almost forgetting my errand. Come! We
must hurry. I've got to go to town. Want to row
me over?"</p>

<p>"You bet your life!"</p>

<p>"It may be quite a pull. The tide is running out
and that means you will have to row against it."</p>

<p>"Show me the boat."</p>

<p>Still she hesitated.</p>

<p>"I don't know how nautical you are."</p>

<p>She thought she heard him chuckle.</p>

<p>Leading the way to the yellow dory, she took her
place opposite him and he pushed off.</p>

<p>As they sat facing one another, her eyes roamed
over his brown suit; his matching tie, handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and socks; his immaculate linen; his general air of
careful grooming, and she could not but admit he
wore his clothes well. She was so accustomed to
seeing him that she never before had stopped to
analyze his appearance. Now after weeks of separation
she regarded him from a fresh viewpoint and
realized with something of a shock how very good-looking
he was.</p>

<p>He had the appearance of being scrubbed inside
and out&mdash;of being not only clean but wholesome
and upstanding; of knowing what he wanted and
going after it.</p>

<p>He was not a small town product.</p>

<p>Three years in an eastern preparatory school, followed
by four years of college life had knocked all
that might have been provincial out of Horatio
Junior.</p>

<p>Nevertheless these reflections, interesting though
they were, proved nothing about his knowledge of
the water.</p>

<p>Then she suddenly became aware that the boat
was being guided by a master hand.</p>

<p>"Why, Hortie Fuller, I had no idea you could
row like this!" exclaimed she with admiration.</p>

<p>Horatio deigned no response.</p>

<p>"Wherever did you learn to pull such an oar?"</p>

<p>"Varsity Crew."</p>

<p>"Of course. I had forgotten," she apologized, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
eyes following as with each splendid stroke the
craft shot forward.</p>

<p>Although the oarsman ignored her approbation he
was not unmindful of it.</p>

<p>"Where do we land?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Anywhere."</p>

<p>He bent forward and with one final magnificent
sweep sent the nose of the dory out of the channel.</p>

<p>"Come on," he called, leaping to the beach.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, Hortie&mdash;I can't get ashore here.
I'll wet my white shoes."</p>

<p>"Jump."</p>

<p>"It's too far. Pull the boat higher on the sand."</p>

<p>"Not on your life. Jump, darling! I'll catch
you."</p>

<p>She stood up in the bow.</p>

<p>"I can't. It's too far."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Where's your sporting blood? Don't
be afraid. I'm right here."</p>

<p>"Suppose you shouldn't catch me?"</p>

<p>"But I shall."</p>

<p>He would. She was certain of it.</p>

<p>Still she wavered.</p>

<p>"I don't want to jump," she pouted.</p>

<p>"You'll have to. Come on, Beautiful. You're
wasting time."</p>

<p>"I think you are perfectly horrid," she flung out
as she sprang forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>An instant later she was in his arms and tight in a
grip she knew herself powerless to loosen.</p>

<p>"Let me go, Hortie! Let me go!" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"I shall, sweetheart. All in good time. Before I
set you free, though, we must settle one trivial point.
Are we engaged or are we not?"</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>"If we're not," he went on, "I intend to duck
you in the water. If we are, you shall tell me you
love me and go free."</p>

<p>"Don't be idiotic, Hortie. Please, please let me
go. Somebody may come along and see us."</p>

<p>"I don't mind if they do. There are other considerations
more important."</p>

<p>A swift, shy smile illuminated her face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't want to be ducked, Hortie," she
murmured, raising her arms to his neck.</p>

<p>"You precious thing! You shan't be. Now the
rest of it. Say you love me."</p>

<p>"I guess you know that."</p>

<p>"But I wish to hear you say it."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;think I do."</p>

<p>"That's a half-hearted statement."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;know I do, Hortie."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is better. And I love you, Sylvia. Loving
you is an old, old story with me&mdash;a sort of
habit. I shall never change. You are too much a
part of me, Sylvia. Now pay the boatman and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
shall go. One is too cheap. Two is miserly. The
fare is three. I won't take less."</p>

<p>"I consider your methods despicable," announced
the girl when at last he reluctantly put her down on
her feet.</p>

<p>"A warrior must study his adversary and plan his
attack accordingly."</p>

<p>"You blackmailed me."</p>

<p>"I know my Sylvia," he countered.</p>

<p>"Just the same you had no right to take advantage."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd rather I trundled back to New
York tomorrow and offered the ring to Estelle."</p>

<p>"Silly! I was only fooling," she protested quickly,
linking her arm in his. "This ring would never fit
Estelle, dearest. Her hands are tremendous. Didn't
you ever notice them? They are almost as large as
a man's. I never saw such hands."</p>

<p>"She's an awful nice girl just the same."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that. Come. We must quit fooling
now and hurry or we shall never get home.
Marcia will be frantic."</p>

<p>"Marcia?"</p>

<p>"My aunt. I have so much to tell you I hardly
know where to begin," sighed Sylvia. "Do listen
carefully, for I need your advice."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"A lot of things. It is a long story. You see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Marcia has fallen in love with a robber."</p>

<p>"A robber? Your aunt?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. I know it sounds odd, but you will understand
it better after you have heard the details,"
nodded Sylvia. "This man, a jewel thief, came to
our house one day shipwrecked and hurt, so we
took him in."</p>

<p>"A thief?"</p>

<p>Again she nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes. We didn't know then, of course, that he
was a thief. Afterward, when we did, he was sick
and we hadn't the heart to turn him out. In fact
we couldn't have done it anyway. He was too
fascinating. He was one of the most fascinating men
you ever saw."</p>

<p>"He must have been," Horatio growled.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was. I myself almost lost my heart to
him," confessed Sylvia earnestly. "Don't jeer. I
am speaking the truth. I did not quite fall in love
with him, but I came near it. Marcia did."</p>

<p>"Your aunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't look so horrified, Hortie. I realize
it seems queer, unconventional; but you'll understand
better when you see Marcia. She is no ordinary
person."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think she was."</p>

<p>Sylvia ignored the comment.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, the robber hid the loot and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
course Marcia and I did all we could to protect him."</p>

<p>"Why of course?"</p>

<p>"I just told you&mdash;because he was so fascinating&mdash;because
Marcia did not or would not believe he
had stolen it. I knew better. Still I helped shield
him just the same. Then one day the Wilton sheriff
heard over the radio there had been a jewel robbery
on Long Island, and stumbling upon the hidden
gems, arrested Mr. Heath."</p>

<p>"Mr. Heath?"</p>

<p>"The thief, Hortie! The thief! How can you
be so stupid?" ejaculated Sylvia sharply, squeezing
his arm.</p>

<p>"I get you now. You must admit, though, this is
some story to understand."</p>

<p>"I know it sounds confused, but in reality it is
perfectly simple if you'll just pay attention. Well,"
the girl hurried on, "I cannot stop to explain all the
twists and turns but anyway, the sheriff brought the
burglar to Wilton and Marcia is broken-hearted."</p>

<p>"Broken-hearted! I should think she'd be thankful
to be rid of him."</p>

<p>"But you keep forgetting she's in love with him."</p>

<p>"Well, do you wonder I do? What kind of a
woman is your aunt? What sort of a gang have you
got in with anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Hortie! You mustn't talk like that,"
Sylvia declared. "This affair is too serious. Marcia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and the&mdash;the&mdash;she and Mr. Heath love one another.
It is terrible because, you see, he has a
wife."</p>

<p>"I should call that a stroke of Providence, myself."</p>

<p>"Horatio, I think you are being very nasty. You
are joking about something that is no joking matter."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, dear. I wasn't really joking.
Don't be angry. But this yarn is unbelievable&mdash;preposterous,"
explained the man, taking her hand
and gently caressing it.</p>

<p>"I realize it sounds&mdash;unusual."</p>

<p>"Unusual is mild."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;perhaps a little theatrical. Yet, for all
that, it isn't. Now do stop interrupting and let me
finish. When Mr. Heath went away from the Homestead,
he left behind him a hundred dollars in payment
for what Marcia had done for him. It almost
killed her."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she&mdash;thought she ought to have had
more, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Horatio!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;a hundred dollars is quite a sum in these
days. She would better have grabbed it tight and
been thankful. My respect for this bandit chap is
rising. I should call him an honest gentleman."</p>

<p>"It is useless to talk with you, Horatio&mdash;I can
see that," Sylvia said, stiffening. "A delicate affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
like this is evidently beyond your comprehension.
You can't seem to understand it. All you do is to
make light of every word I say."</p>

<p>"I'm not making light. On the contrary I guess
I am taking the situation far more seriously than you
are. I don't like the moral tone of this place at all.
It looks to me as if you had got into most undesirable
surroundings. It is high time I came and took you
out of them. Thieves, and jewel-robberies, and sheriffs,
and bandits with wives&mdash;Heavens! Alton City
is a Garden of Eden compared with this town. The
sooner you are married to me, young woman, and out
of here the better. As for this remarkable aunt of
yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, Horatio! Stop right where you are,"
bridled Sylvia. "One more word against Marcia and
back home you go so fast you won't be able to see
for dust. I'm in earnest, so watch your step."</p>

<p>"The woman has bewitched you," frowned
Horatio.</p>

<p>"She has. She bewitches everybody. She'll bewitch
you."</p>

<p>"Not on your life!"</p>

<p>"Wait and see. Mr. Heath will bewitch you,
too."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the burglar, bandit, thief&mdash;whatever you
choose to call him. You'll admit it when you meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
him. We are going there now."</p>

<p>"To&mdash;to&mdash;call?"</p>

<p>"To return the check I just told you about.
You're the stupidest man I was ever engaged to,
Horatio. Why can't you listen?"</p>

<p>"I am listening with all my ears."</p>

<p>"Then the trouble is with your imagination,"
Sylvia said in her loftiest tone.</p>

<p>They walked on in silence until presently the
girl stopped before the gate of a small, weather-beaten
cottage.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are at Elisha's," she remarked,
turning in at the gate.</p>

<p>"What's he got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Mercy, Hortie. You'll wear me to a shred.
Elisha is the sheriff. I'm going to coax him to let
us see the prisoner."</p>

<p>"You don't mean the chap is jailed here!
My&mdash;!" he clapped his hand over his mouth.
"Why, any red-blooded man could knock the whole
house flat to the ground with a single blow of his
fist. I'll bet I could."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any other place to put him."</p>

<p>"Well, if he stays incarcerated in a detention pen
like this, he's a noble-minded convict&mdash;that's all I
have to say."</p>

<p>They walked up the narrow clam-shell path,
bordered by iris and thrifty perennials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>As they did so, the sound of a radio drifted through
the open window.</p>

<p>Sylvia peeped in.</p>

<p>Elisha, too intent on the music to hear her step,
was sitting before the loud speaker, smoking.</p>

<p>"I've come to see Mr. Heath," she shouted above
the wails of a crooning orchestra.</p>

<p>"You can't. 'Tain't allowed."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Prisoners are always permitted to
see visitors. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I ain't sure as I'd oughter let you see him," hesitated
Elisha.</p>

<p>"I'll take the responsibility."</p>

<p>"Wal&mdash;mebbe on second thought, 'twill do no
harm," he drawled. "He's round on the back porch.
I'd come with you warn't I waitin' for the news
flashes."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I can find him."</p>

<p>"Say, who you got with you?" called the sheriff
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"A friend from my home town."</p>

<p>"Don't know 'bout his goin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, he won't do any harm. He's nobody&mdash;just
my fiancé."</p>

<p>"Your what?"</p>

<p>"The man I am going to marry."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me! So you're gettin' married, are
you? Good lookin' feller! I heard at the post office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
you had some chap in the offin'. But to let him see
Mr. Heath&mdash;I dunno as 'twould be just&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where I go Horatio goes," Sylvia retorted.</p>

<p>Elisha weakened.</p>

<p>"Wal, in that case&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>She waited to hear no more.</p>

<p>"Come on, Hortie," she called.</p>

<p>Leaving Elisha absorbed in a saxophone solo, the
two rounded the corner of the cottage and found
themselves in the presence of Stanley Heath.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="Chapter_XXI" id="Chapter_XXI">Chapter XXI</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was looking very fit and comfortable, lying at full
length in a Gloucester hammock with cushions beneath
his head, a book in his hand, and a package of
cigarettes within reach.</p>

<p>"Sylvia!" he cried, springing up and advancing
toward her with outstretched hand. "Sylvia!
What a brick you are to come!"</p>

<p>Angry as she was, when face to face with him she
could not resist the contagion of his smile.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you so well," she said. "This is
Mr. Horatio Fuller of Alton City."</p>

<p>Horatio looked Heath up and down and then
stepped forward and gripped his hand with unmistakable
cordiality.</p>

<p>"Mighty glad to know you, sir," was his greeting.
"You seem to have got yourself into a jam. If there
is anything I can do&mdash;any way I can be of service&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Horatio, you forget we are not here to make a
social call," interrupted Sylvia, who had by this time
regained her routed chilliness and indignation. "On
the contrary, Mr. Heath, we have come on a very
painful errand. We are returning this check to you."</p>

<p>She extended it toward him, gingerly holding its
corner in the tips of her fingers as if it were too foul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
a thing to touch. "It was outrageous of you, insulting
to leave a thing of this sort for Marcia&mdash;to attempt
to pay in cash&mdash;kindness such as hers."</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;sorry," Heath stammered.</p>

<p>"Sorry! You couldn't have been very sorry, or
you would have sensed such an act would hurt her
terribly."</p>

<p>Horatio Fuller fumbled nervously with his tie.</p>

<p>"You deserve," swept on young Sylvia with rising
spirit, "to be thrashed. Hortie and I both think so&mdash;don't
we, Hortie?"</p>

<p>Horatio Junior turned crimson.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Sylvia, go easy!" he protested.
"Don't drag me into this. I don't know one darn
thing about it."</p>

<p>"But I've explained everything to you."</p>

<p>"You've tried to. Nevertheless, the whole affair
is beyond me. I can't make head or tail out of it,"
shrugged Horatio. "Suppose I just step inside and
listen to the news flashes while you and Mr. Heath
transact your business. It will be less awkward all
round. If you want me you can speak."</p>

<p>Nodding courteously in Heath's direction, Horatio
Junior disappeared.</p>

<p>"Your Mr. Fuller is a man of nice feeling," Stanley
Heath declared looking after him. "I congratulate
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything is settled then?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I hope you will be very happy."</p>

<p>She did not reply at once. When she did, it was to
say with a humility new and appealing:</p>

<p>"I shall be. I never appreciated Hortie until now.
I was too silly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you were merely young."</p>

<p>"It wasn't that. I was vain&mdash;feather-headed. I
have realized it since knowing Marcia."</p>

<p>"We all want to be different after we have seen
Marcia," Stanley Heath said gently.</p>

<p>"We don't just want to be&mdash;we set about it," was
the girl's grave reply.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Sylvia, and let us talk of Marcia," ventured
Heath after a pause. "I am deeply sorry if I
have wounded her&mdash;indeed I am."</p>

<p>The girl searched his face.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand you, Mr. Heath," she said.
"What has Marcia done that you should have left
her as you did? Hasn't she believed in you through
thick and thin? Stood up for you against everybody&mdash;going
it blind at that? Few women would have
had such faith in a stranger."</p>

<p>"I realize that. You do not need to tell me," he
answered. "It is precisely because she has gone so
far I believed her capable of going farther yet&mdash;the
whole way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean by the whole way?"</p>

<p>"To the end."</p>

<p>"Well, hasn't she?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. She has fallen short&mdash;disappointed me
cruelly. When it came to the final test, her affection
collapsed. Oh, she has been wonderful," he added
quickly. "Do not think I fail to appreciate that.
She has far out-distanced every other woman I ever
have known. I simply expected too much of her,
doubtless the impossible. Human nature is frail&mdash;a
woman's heart the frailest thing of all. I have always
said so."</p>

<p>"You wrong Marcia," cried Sylvia hotly. "Her
heart is not frail. Neither is she the weak sort of
person you have pictured. In all the world you could
not match her loyalty or the depth of her affection.
I owe Marcia a great debt. I could tell you things
she has done that would make you thoroughly
ashamed of your superficial rating of her. But why
go into that? If after the experience we three have
lived through together you have not discovered what
she is, it is futile for me to attempt to show you.</p>

<p>"You came into our lives like a meteor&mdash;entirely
detached from everything. We knew nothing about
you and in the face of damaging evidence you offered
neither Marcia nor me one word of explanation.
Marcia asked none. Without rhyme or reason she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
believed in you. I had not her faith. I freely confess
I thought you guilty. Oh, I liked you sufficiently
well to be ready to help you save your skin. But
Marcia cared enough for you to want you to save
your soul.</p>

<p>"There is a difference in that sort of caring, Mr.
Heath&mdash;a big difference. When you were taken
ill, we both nursed you&mdash;I willingly, she devotedly.
Here lay another difference had you been able to
detect it. What happened as a result of this enforced
intimacy? You know&mdash;know far better
than I."</p>

<p>"I fell in love with Marcia," replied the man without
an instant's hesitation.</p>

<p>"You fell in love!" Sylvia repeated, her lip curling.
"You call it love&mdash;the poor thing you offered
her! Why, Marcia would have gone to the world's
end with you, Stanley Heath, had she the right. She
would have faced any humiliation for your sake. If
prison doors closed upon you, she would have remained
faithful until they swung open and afterward
followed you to any corner of the earth in which you
chose to begin a new life."</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong, Sylvia," contradicted
Heath. "Marcia was not ready to do that. I tried
her out and she refused. When I told her I should
return to her, and asked her in so many words
whether she was willing to face shame and public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
scorn for my sake she turned her back on me. She
could not go to that length."</p>

<p>"Are you sure she understood?" asked Sylvia,
stepping nearer and looking fearlessly into his eyes.
"There is a shame Marcia never in this world would
face for any man; but it is not the shame you have
just described.</p>

<p>"It is the shame of wronging another woman; destroying
a home. I know that sounds old-fashioned
in days like these. Perhaps Marcia is old-fashioned.
Perhaps I am. In the villages where we have been
brought up, we do not go in for the new standards
sponsored by more up-to-date communities. We believe
in marriage as a sacred, enduring sacrament&mdash;not
a bond to be lightly broken. When you offered
Marcia less than that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never offered Marcia any such shameful position,
Sylvia," cried Stanley Heath. "I would not
so far insult her."</p>

<p>"But you are married."</p>

<p>"That is a lie. Who told you so?"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the wire to Mrs. Stanley Heath&mdash;the
telephone message. I heard you call her Joan."</p>

<p>"But, Sylvia, Mrs. Stanley Heath is not my wife.
She is my young step-mother, my father's widow. I
always have called her Joan."</p>

<p>"Oh! I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"I see it all now," the man exclaimed. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
have entirely misunderstood the situation. I'm a
Junior. Since my father's death, however, people
have got out of the way of using the term. Sometimes
I myself am careless about it. So Marcia
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course she did. We both did. So did Elisha
Winslow and Eleazer Crocker. So did lots of other
people in Wilton."</p>

<p>"Heavens!"</p>

<p>"Well, how were we to know?" Sylvia demanded.</p>

<p>"How, indeed? If an innocent citizen cannot visit
a town without being arrested as a criminal within
a week of his arrival, why shouldn't he be married
without his knowledge? Circumstantial evidence
can, apparently, work wonders."</p>

<p>Then suddenly he threw back his head and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Bless you, little Sylvia&mdash;bless you for setting
me right. I told you you were a brick and you've
proved it. Thanks to you, everything is now
straightened out."</p>

<p>"Not quite everything, I am afraid," the girl protested.</p>

<p>"Everything that is of importance," he amended.
"The rest will untangle itself in time. I am not
worrying about it. Here, give me your hand. How
am I to thank you for what you have done? I only
hope that young Horatio Fuller of yours realizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
what a treasure he is getting."</p>

<p>"He does, Mr. Heath&mdash;he does," observed that
gentleman, strolling at the same instant through the
door and encircling his tiny bride-to-be with his arm.
"Haven't I traveled half way across this big country
of ours to marry her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we're not going to be married yet, Hortie,"
demurred the girl trying to wrench herself free of
the big fellow's hold.</p>

<p>"Certainly we are, my dear. Didn't you know
that? I'm surprised how many things there are that
you don't know," he went on teasingly. "I thought
I explained exactly what brought me East. Didn't
I tell you this morning I came to get married? I was
perfectly serious. Dad gave me two months vacation
with that understanding. I must either produce
a wife when I get home or lose my job. He'll never
give me another furlough if I don't."</p>

<p>"Looks to me as if you had Mr. Fuller's future
prosperity in your hands, Sylvia," Heath said.</p>

<p>"She has. She can make or break me. A big responsibility,
eh, little Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"I know it, Hortie," retorted the girl seriously.</p>

<p>"She is equal to it, Fuller&mdash;never fear," Stanley
Heath asserted.</p>

<p>"I'm not doing any worrying," smiled Horatio.
"I&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The sentence was cut short by the radio's loudspeaker:</p>

<p><cite>The much sought Long Island gem thief was captured
this morning at his lodgings in Jersey City.
Harris Chalmers, alias Jimmie O'Hara, a paroled
prisoner, was taken by the police at his room on K&mdash; Street.
A quantity of loot, together with firearms
and the missing jewels were found concealed in the
apartment. The man readily admitted the theft.
He has a long prison record.</cite></p>

<p>For a second nobody spoke.</p>

<p>Then as if prompted by common impulse, the three
on the piazza rushed indoors.</p>

<p>Elisha was sitting limply before the radio.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Well, rather!" Horatio Fuller shouted with a
triumphant wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"Ain't it the beateree?" exploded the astonished
sheriff. "That sends the whole case up in the air.
All that's needed now to make me out the darndest
fool on God's earth is for Eleazer's young nephew-lawyer
in New York, who's checking up Heath's
story, to wire everything there is O.K. If he does,
I'll go bury my head. There goes the telephone!
That's him! That's Eleazer&mdash;I'll bet a hat."</p>

<p>"<cite>Hello!&mdash;Yes, I heard it.&mdash;You ain't surprised?
Wal, I am. I'm took off my feet.&mdash;Oh, your nephew</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
<cite>wired, did he, an' everything's O.K.? That bein' the
case, I reckon there's no more to be said. I feel like
a shrimp. How do you feel?</cite>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Elisha hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Wal, Mr. Heath, the story you told Eleazer an'
me is straight as a string in every particular," he announced.
"You're free! There ain't nothin' I can
say. To tell you I'm sorry ain't in no way adequate.
I shan't offer you my hand neither, 'cause I know
you wouldn't take it&mdash;leastways I wouldn't, was I
in your place. There's some insults nothin' can wipe
out an' this blunder of mine is one of 'em. You'll
just have to set me down as one of them puddin'-headed
idiots that was over-ambitious to do his duty.
I ain't got no other explanation or excuse to make."</p>

<p>"I shall not let it go at that, Mr. Winslow," Stanley
Heath acclaimed, stepping to the old man's side
and seizing his palm in a strong grip. "We all make
errors. Forget it. I'm going to. Besides, you have
treated me like a prince since I've been your guest."</p>

<p>"You are the prince, sir. Livin' with you has
shown me that. Had I knowed you 'fore I arrested
you as well as I do now the thing wouldn't 'a' happened.
Wal, anyhow, all ain't been lost. At least
I've met a thoroughbred an' that ain't none too frequent
an occurrence in these days."</p>

<p>"What I can't understand, Mr. Winslow, is why
you didn't recognize he was a thoroughbred from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the beginning," Horatio Fuller remarked.</p>

<p>"You've a right to berate me, young man&mdash;a perfect
right. I ain't goin' to put up no defense. 'Twas
the circumstances that blinded me. Besides, I had
only a single glimpse of Mr. Heath. Remember that.
After he was took sick I never saw him again. Had
we got acquainted, as we have now, everything would
'a' been different. Findin' them jewels&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great hat, man! I had a diamond ring in my
pocket when I came to Wilton, but that didn't prove
I'd stolen it."</p>

<p>"I know! I know!" acquiesced the sheriff.
"Eleazer an' me lost our bearin's entirely. We got
completely turned round."</p>

<p>"A thief with a Phi Beta Kappa key!" jeered
Horatio. "Godfrey!" Then turning to Sylvia, he
added in an undertone: "Well, so far as I can see the
only person who has kept her head through this affair
is our Aunt Marcia."</p>

<p>Elisha overheard the final clause.</p>

<p>"That's right!" he agreed with cordiality.
"You're 'xactly right, Mr. Fuller. The Widder's
head-piece can always be relied upon to stay steady."</p>

<p>"Whose head-piece?" inquired Stanley Heath,
puzzled by the term.</p>

<p>"Marcia's. Here in town we call her The Widder."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll not have the opportunity to call her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
that much longer," Heath laughed.</p>

<p>"You don't tell me!" Elisha regarded him, open-mouthed.
"Humph! So that's how the wind blows,
is it? Wal, I can see this mix-up would 'a' ended my
chances anyway. Marcia'd never have had me after
this. Disappointed as I am, though, there's a sight
of comfort in knowin' she won't have Eleazer neither.
He don't come out of the shindy a whit better'n me.
That's somethin'. In fact it's a heap!"</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XXII" id="Chapter_XXII">Chapter XXII</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Intense</span> as was the joy of the three persons, who a
little later set out toward the Homestead in the old
yellow dory, they were a silent trio.</p>

<p>Too much of seriousness had happened during the
morning for them to dispel its aftermath lightly.</p>

<p>Horatio, pulling at the oars, was unusually earnest,
Sylvia turned the ring on her finger reflectively
and Stanley Heath looked far out over the
water, too deep in thought to be conscious of either
of them.</p>

<p>When, however, the boat swung into the channel,
Sylvia spoke.</p>

<p>"Hortie and I are not coming with you, Mr.
Heath," she said. "We will stay behind. Only do,
please, promise me one thing. Do not tell Marcia
the whole story before we have a chance to hear it.
There are ever so many connecting links I am curious
beyond words to have you supply."</p>

<p>"Such as&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The jewels in the first place. I can hardly wait
to have that mystery solved."</p>

<p>Stanley laughed.</p>

<p>"The jewels are no mystery at all. I can satisfy
your mind about those here and now. They were
Joan's&mdash;Mrs. Heath's. Her maid, Corinne, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
them and disappeared. Soon afterward, purely by
accident, I met Paul Latimer, a friend who lives on
Long Island, and played squash with him at the
club and during the course of our conversation, he
asked if I knew of a good man servant, saying that
Julien, their butler, had just given notice that he
was to be married shortly to Corinne, the new
parlor-maid, and return with her to France.</p>

<p>"The woman's name instantly caught my attention.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I do a bit of sleuthing on my own
account?</p>

<p>"Thus far the detectives Joan and I had hired
had made no headway at locating the jewels.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I have a try at it myself? It
chanced I had ordered a power-boat built in Rhode
Island and had for some time been awaiting an
opportunity to test her out. Why not combine the
two errands?</p>

<p>"I got the boat and used her a couple of days, and
finding her satisfactory cruised along to the Latimers'
at whose house I had frequently stayed, and
with the habits of whose household I was familiar.
My plan was to arrive early in the morning before
the family was astir and catch the parlor-maid alone
at her work.</p>

<p>"Should she prove to be our Corinne, I would
boldly confront her with the theft and demand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
jewels; if, on the other hand, she turned out to be
another person altogether, it would be perfectly easy
to explain my presence by falling back on my acquaintance
with Paul.</p>

<p>"It seemed, on thinking the matter over, that this
would be a far more considerate course anyway than
to drag in the detectives, not only because I had no
real evidence to present to them, but also because
of my friendship for the Latimers and for Julien,
who had been in their employ many years. I knew
they esteemed him very highly and would be dreadfully
cut up should they find him involved in an
affair as unpleasant as this one. Beside, I felt practically
certain he had had nothing to do with the
crime. He was too fine&mdash;one of the old-fashioned,
devoted type of servant.</p>

<p>"To shame such a man and throw suspicion on
him if he were blameless would be a pity, especially
just on the eve of his resigning from service. It
might mean that instead of leaving with the gratitude
and good-will of his employers, he might be
sent away under a cloud. I did not wish that to
happen.</p>

<p>"Well, my scheme worked to a dot.</p>

<p>"I reached the Latimers' unobserved; found Corinne
alone straightening up the library; faced her
and demanded the jewels.</p>

<p>"The instant she saw me she knew the game was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
up. Nevertheless, she made a pretense of denying
the crime until I threatened to send for Julien, at
which suggestion she broke down and, without more
ado, produced the gems from her pocket, shouldering
all the blame.</p>

<p>"Julien, she protested, knew nothing of the theft.
He was a self-respecting, honest man. Should he be
told of what she had done it would end everything
between them. She loved him. Indeed it was because
of him she had committed the crime.</p>

<p>"It proved they had been engaged some time and
long before had agreed to save their money and sometime
pool it so they might be married and buy a little
home in France.</p>

<p>"Julien had saved conscientiously; but Corinne
had been extravagant and let the major part of her
earnings slip through her fingers. He was now asking
how much she had laid aside and to her consternation
she found she had almost nothing.</p>

<p>"She was ashamed to face him.</p>

<p>"What could she say?</p>

<p>"She did not know what impulse prompted her
to take the jewels. She had never stolen before in
all her life. The diamonds had been constantly in
her care and it had never occurred to her to appropriate
them. It had been a sudden, mad temptation
created by the need of money and she had
yielded to it without thought. Scarcely were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
gems in her possession before she regretted her action
and longed to undo it. She would have taken
them back had she not feared the consequences. She
begged Julien should not be told what she had done.
If her crime could be concealed from him she was
willing to make any restitution I demanded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was a sentimental fool. Anyway I
simply could not see it my duty to hand the unhappy
creature over to the authorities; destroy
Julien's faith in her; wipe out the future she had
set her heart upon. She was young, with life before
her. I felt sure if given a chance she would make
good.</p>

<p>"Promising I would remain silent, I pocketed the
gems and came away.</p>

<p>"Whether I acted rightly or wrongly I do not
know.</p>

<p>"I suppose by this time the two are married and
on their way to France. I believe Corinne told the
truth and that under other influences she will become
an excellent wife and mother. At least she
has the opportunity.</p>

<p>"The other half of my tale&mdash;the half I neither
foresaw nor planned&mdash;is familiar to you.</p>

<p>"The fog that drove me out of my course; my
subsequent shipwreck and illness; the coming of
Currier, our old family servant; the chain of circumstances
that brought upon me the calamities from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
which I have just extricated myself&mdash;these are an
old story. The only thing that now remains to clear
my sky is for me to right myself with Marcia."</p>

<p>"That will be easy," smiled Sylvia.</p>

<p>"I wish I thought so," was Heath's moody answer.</p>

<p>"Marcia is no ordinary woman. Her understanding
and love are measureless. Love, Mr. Heath, forgives
a great deal."</p>

<p>"I know it does. In that lies my only hope."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She was not in the house when at last Stanley
Heath overtook her, but far up the beach tossing
driftwood into the surf for Prince Hal to retrieve.</p>

<p>The man paused, watching them.</p>

<p>Hatless, her splendid body aglow with exercise,
Marcia had the freedom and wholesomeness of a
young athlete. She threw the sticks with the overhand
swing of a boy pitching a ball. Yet with all
her strength and muscular ease, there was a grace
unmistakably feminine in her every movement.
Feminine, too, and very beautiful was her finely
poised head, her blowing hair, her glorious color,
and her sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>When she turned and saw him, she uttered a faint
cry, but she did not advance to meet him. Prince
Hal did that, racing up the beach, uttering shrill
yelps of welcome as he came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>A second and the dog was again at Marcia's side,
and in this ecstasy of delight he continued to run
back and forth until Stanley Heath had covered the
sandy curve that intervened and himself stood beside
her.</p>

<p>"Marcia&mdash;dearest&mdash;I have come back&mdash;come
to ask your forgiveness. I misjudged you cruelly
the night we parted and in anger spoke words I had
no right to speak. Forgive me, dear! Forgive me!
Can you?"</p>

<p>"I forgave you long ago&mdash;before you asked," she
whispered.</p>

<p>"Forgave without understanding&mdash;how like you!
But you must not do that. You have more to forgive
in me than you know, Marcia. I have been
proud, unbelieving, unworthy of a love like yours.
I have made you suffer&mdash;suffer needlessly. Listen
to what I have to tell and then see if you can still
forgive."</p>

<p>Turning, they walked slowly along the shore.</p>

<p>"I could have told you about the jewels and how
I came by them at the outset had I not suddenly
conceived the idea of teasing you. The plan to conceal
my story came to me as a form of sport&mdash;a
subtle, psychological game. Here I was pitched
without ceremony into a strange environment among
persons who knew nothing of my background.
What would they make of me? How rate me when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
cut off from my real setting? I resolved to try out
the experiment. Women are said to be inquisitive,
particularly those living in isolation. My advent
could not but stimulate questions. I thought it
would be an amusing adventure to circumvent not
only your curiosity but also that of the village.</p>

<p>"I placed scant dependence on feminine discernment
and constancy.</p>

<p>"When I went to the war, I left behind a girl who
pledged herself to love and wait for me. When I
came back it was to find her married to my best
friend. The discovery shook my confidence in human
nature, and especially in women, to its foundations.
I derided love, vowing I never would marry
and be made a puppet of a second time.</p>

<p>"The remainder of the story you know.</p>

<p>"I stumbled, a stranger, into your home and instantly
you set at naught all my preconceived theories
of womanhood by believing in me with an
unreasoning faith. You asked no questions. You
did not even exhibit a legitimate curiosity in the
peculiar network of circumstances that entangled
me. You were a new type of being and I regarded
you with wonder.</p>

<p>"Still, I was not satisfied. I felt sure that if
pressed too far your trust in me would crumble and,
therefore, I tried deliberately to break it down by
throwing obstacles in its pathway. When suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
closed in upon me I put you to further tests by withholding
the explanations I could easily have made.
It was a contemptible piece of egoism&mdash;selfish and
cruel&mdash;and dearly have I paid for it. But at least
remember that if I caused you suffering I have suffered
also.</p>

<p>"For, Marcia, through it all I loved you. I recognized
from the moment I first looked into your eyes
that a force mightier than ourselves drew us together&mdash;a
force not to be denied. Nevertheless, so
bitter had been my experience I dared not yield to
this strange new power. Instead I opposed it with
all my strength, giving my love reluctantly, fighting
inch by inch the surrender I sensed to be inevitable.</p>

<p>"You, on the other hand, had like myself known
betrayal, but you had taken the larger view and not
allowed it to warp or mar your outlook on life.
When love came knocking a second time, you were
neither too proud nor too cowardly to answer it,
but freely gave your affection with the gladness and
sincerity so characteristic of you.</p>

<p>"I do not deserve such a love.</p>

<p>"Beside the largeness of your nature my own
shows itself childish&mdash;a small, poor thing for which
I blush.</p>

<p>"Help me to erase the past.</p>

<p>"I love you with my whole soul, dear. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>thing in me loves you. My life is worth nothing unless
you share it.</p>

<p>"Will you?</p>

<p>"Ah, you need not fear, Marcia. Sylvia has told
me everything. Beloved, there is not and never has
been a barrier to our marriage. We have misunderstood
one another. Let us do so no longer.</p>

<p>"I am a free man&mdash;acquitted.</p>

<p>"I also am free of any claim that would hinder our
wedding. Come to me and let us begin life afresh."</p>

<p>She came then, swiftly.</p>

<p>As he held her in his arms, the last shadow that
separated them melted away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Under the glow of the noonday sun, they walked
back toward the Homestead, hand in hand.</p>

<p>Sylvia came running to meet them and, throwing
her arms about Marcia, kissed her.</p>

<p>"Everything is all right&mdash;I can see that," she
cried. "Oh, I am so glad&mdash;so glad for both of
you! I believe I just could not stand it if you were
not happy, because I am so happy myself. Hortie
is here, you know. Didn't Stanley tell you? Why,
Stanley Heath, aren't you ashamed to forget all
about Hortie and me? Yes, Hortie came this morning.
We're engaged. See my ring!"</p>

<p>"Ring!" repeated Heath. "Mercy on us, Marcia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
you must have a ring. I cannot allow this young
sprite of a niece to outdo you. I am afraid I was
not as foresighted as Mr. Fuller, however. Still, I
can produce a ring, such as it is. Here, dear, you
shall wear this until I can get something better."</p>

<p>He slipped from his little finger the wrought-gold
ring with its beautifully cut diamond.</p>

<p>"I picked this up in India," he said. "I am sure
it will fit. Try it, Marcia."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;do not need a ring," murmured she,
drawing back and putting her hands nervously behind
her.</p>

<p>"Of course you do," interposed Sylvia. "How
absurd! A ring is part of being engaged."</p>

<p>"A very, very small part," Marcia answered.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is a part," the girl insisted.
"Come, don't be silly. Let Stanley put it on."</p>

<p>Playfully she caught Marcia's hands and imprisoning
them, drew them forward.</p>

<p>On the left one glistened a narrow gold band.</p>

<p>"Jason's!" cried Sylvia. "Jason's! Take it off
and give it to me. You owe nothing to Jason. Even
I, a Howe, would not have you preserve longer that
worn out allegiance, neither would my mother. The
past is dead. You have closed the door upon it.
You said so yourself. Never think of it again. You
belong to Stanley now&mdash;to Stanley and to no one
else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>As she spoke, Sylvia took the ring from the older
woman's hand and held it high in the air.</p>

<p>"The past is dead," she repeated, "and the last
reminder of it&mdash;is&mdash;gone."</p>

<p>There was a gleam as the golden band spun aloft
and catching an instant the sunlight's glory, disappeared
beneath the foam that marked the line
of incoming breakers.</p>

<p>"Now, Stanley, put your ring upon her finger. It
is a symbol of a new life, of hope, of happier things.
Isn't it so, Marcia?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!"</p>

<p>Sylvia drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"There! Now we'll not be serious a minute
longer. This is the greatest day of our four lives.
There must not be even a shadow in our heaven.
Kiss me, Marcia, and come and meet Hortie. Poor
dear! He is paralyzed with fright at the thought of
appearing into your presence. I left him hiding behind
the door. I could not coax him out of the
house."</p>

<p>"How ridiculous! You must have made me out
an ogre."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I made you out an enchantress.
I told him you would bewitch him. That's why he
became panic-stricken. Do be nice to him&mdash;for my
sake. He really is a lamb."</p>

<p>Sylvia stepped to the piazza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Horatio," called she imperiously. "Come out
here right away and meet your Aunt Marcia. And
please, Stanley, forgive me for mistaking you for a
bandit. I'm dreadfully mortified. Still, you must
admit circumstantial evidence was strong against
you. All of which proves on what shifting sands
rest our moral characters!"</p>

<p>"Say rather our reputations, dear child," Heath
corrected.</p>
